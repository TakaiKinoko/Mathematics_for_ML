#### Rational exponent rule
* Q: Given y = x <sup>m/n</sup> where m and n are integers, compute dy/dx.
* Sol: dy/dx = (m/n)x<sup>(m/n-1)</sup>

#### derivative to non-functions

x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 1

* step 1: use the operator d/dx on both sides
    d/dx (x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>) = d/dx 1
* step 2: simplify and use sum rule
    d/dx x<sup>2</sup> + d/dx y<sup>2</sup> = 0
* step 3: use basic rule on x<sup>2</sup> and chain rule on y<sup>2</sup>
    2x + 2y dy/dx = 0
* step 4: simplify
    dy/dx = - x/y
