### Linear Approximation
* meaning: the curve line is approximately the tangent line
* curve y = f(x)
* tangent line of the curve  y = f(x<sub>0</sub>) + f'(x<sub>0</sub>)(x-x<sub>0</sub>) 
* the curve is approximately equal to its tangent line
* Example: f(x) = ln x, f'(x) = 1/x
    * x<sub>0</sub> = 1
    * f(1) = ln 1 = 0
    * f'(1) = 1 
    * ln x = 0 + 1*(x-1) = x - 1 
    * line y = x-1 and the curve y = ln x are near at the point x = 1
