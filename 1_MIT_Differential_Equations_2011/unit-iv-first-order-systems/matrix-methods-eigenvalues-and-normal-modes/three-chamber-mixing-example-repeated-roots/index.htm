<p><span m="13000">I just want to remind you of the main facts.</span> <span m="16000">The first thing that you have to do is, of course,</span> <span m="19000">we are going to have to be doing it several times today.</span> <span m="23000">That is the system we are trying to solve.</span> <span m="26000">And the first thing you have to do is find a characteristic</span> <span m="31000">equation which is general form, although this is not the form</span> <span m="35000">you should use for two-by-two, is A minus lambda I</span> <span m="39000">equals zero. And its roots are the</span> <span m="42000">eigenvalues.</span> <span m="50000">And then with each eigenvalue you then have to calculate its</span> <span m="55000">eigenvector, which you do by solving the system (A minus</span> <span m="59000">lambda1, let's say, times I) alpha equals zero</span> <span m="64000">because the solution is the eigenvector</span> <span m="69000">alpha 1. And then the final solution</span> <span m="72000">that you make out of the two of them looks like alpha 1 times e</span> <span m="78000">to the lambda 1t.</span> <span m="81000">Of course you do that for each eigenvalue.</span> <span m="85000">You get the associated eigenvector.</span> <span m="90000">And then the general solution is made up out of a linear</span> <span m="95000">combination of these individual guys with constant coefficients.</span> <span m="100000">The lecture today is devoted to the two cases where things do</span> <span m="106000">not go as smoothly as they seem to in the homework problems you</span> <span m="111000">have been doing up until now. The first one will take</span> <span m="116000">probably most of the period. It deals with what happens when</span> <span m="122000">an eigenvalue gets repeated. But I think since the situation</span> <span m="126000">is a little more complicated than it is where the case of a</span> <span m="130000">characteristic root gets repeated in the case of a</span> <span m="134000">second-order equation as we saw it, you know what to do in that</span> <span m="138000">case, here there are different possibilities.</span> <span m="142000">And I thought the best thing to do would be to illustrate them</span> <span m="146000">on an example. So here is a problem.</span> <span m="150000">It came out of a mild nightmare, but I won't bore you</span> <span m="154000">with the details. Anyway, we have this circular</span> <span m="158000">fish tank. It is a very modern fish tank.</span> <span m="162000">It is divided into three compartments because one holds</span> <span m="167000">Siamese fighting fish and one goldfish, and one-- They should</span> <span m="172000">not eat each other. And it is going to be a simple</span> <span m="177000">temperature problem. The three actual compartments</span> <span m="182000">have to be kept at different temperatures because one is for</span> <span m="186000">tropical fish and one is for arctic fish and one is for</span> <span m="190000">everyday garden variety fish. But the guy forgets to turn on</span> <span m="195000">the heater so the temperatures start out what they are supposed</span> <span m="199000">to be, tropical, icy, and normal.</span> <span m="202000">But as the day wears on, of course, the three</span> <span m="205000">compartments trade their heat and sort of tend to all end up</span> <span m="210000">at the same temperature. So we are going to let (x)i</span> <span m="215000">equal the temperature in tank i. Now, these are separated from</span> <span m="220000">each other by glass things. Everything is identical,</span> <span m="224000">each has the same volume, and the same glass partition</span> <span m="228000">separates them out and no heat can escape.</span> <span m="231000">This is very well-insulated with very double-thick</span> <span m="235000">Thermopane glass or something like that.</span> <span m="240000">You can see in, but heat cannot get out very</span> <span m="243000">well. Heat essentially is conducted</span> <span m="246000">from one of these cells to the other.</span> <span m="248000">And let's assume that the water in each tank is kept stirred up</span> <span m="253000">because the fish are swimming around in it.</span> <span m="257000">That should be a pretty decent way of stirring a fish tank.</span> <span m="261000">The question is how do each of these, as a function of time,</span> <span m="266000">and I want to know how they behave over time,</span> <span m="269000">so find these functions.</span> <span m="280000">Well, we are going to find them in solutions to differential</span> <span m="283000">equations. And the differential equations</span> <span m="285000">are not hard to set up. They are very much like the</span> <span m="288000">diffusion equation you had for homework or the equations we</span> <span m="291000">studied in the beginning of the term.</span> <span m="293000">Let's do one carefully because the others go exactly the same</span> <span m="297000">way. What determines the flow,</span> <span m="299000">the change in temperature? Well, it is the conductivity</span> <span m="303000">across the barriers. But there are two barriers</span> <span m="306000">because heat can flow into this first cell, both from this guy</span> <span m="310000">and it can flow across this glass pane from the other cell.</span> <span m="314000">We have to take account of both of those possibilities.</span> <span m="317000">It is like in your homework. The little diffusion cell that</span> <span m="321000">was in the middle could get contributions from both sides,</span> <span m="325000">whereas, the two guys on the end could only get contribution</span> <span m="329000">from one. But here, nobody is on the end.</span> <span m="334000">It is circular table. Everyone is dying equally.</span> <span m="338000">Everybody can get input from the other two cells.</span> <span m="343000">x1 prime is some constant of conductivity times</span> <span m="348000">the temperature difference between tank three and tank one.</span> <span m="354000">And then there is another term which comes from tank two.</span> <span m="361000">So a times tank two minus the temperature difference,</span> <span m="364000">tank two minus tank one. Let's write this out.</span> <span m="367000">Remember there will be other equations, too.</span> <span m="370000">But instead of doing this, let's do a more careful job</span> <span m="374000">with this first equation. When I write it out,</span> <span m="377000">remember, the important thing is you are going to have x1,</span> <span m="381000">x2, x3 down the left, so they have to occur in the</span> <span m="384000">same order on the right in order to use these standard eigenvalue</span> <span m="389000">techniques. The coefficient of x1 is going</span> <span m="393000">to be minus a x1 and then another minus a x1.</span> <span m="398000">In other words, it is going to be minus 2 ax1.</span> <span m="402000">And then the x2 term will be plus a x2.</span> <span m="406000">And the x3 term will be plus a x3.</span> <span m="409000">Well, you can see now that is the equation for x1 prime in</span> <span m="415000">terms of the other variables. But there is symmetry.</span> <span m="420000">There is no difference between this tank, that tank,</span> <span m="424000">and that tank as far as the differential equations are</span> <span m="428000">concerned. And, therefore,</span> <span m="430000">I can get the equations for the other two tanks by just changing</span> <span m="435000">1 to 2, just switching the subscripts.</span> <span m="438000">When I finally do it all, the equations are going to be,</span> <span m="442000">I will write them first out as a system.</span> <span m="447000">Let's take a equal 1 because I am going to want to</span> <span m="450000">solve them numerically, and I want you to be able to</span> <span m="454000">concentrate on what is important, what is new now and</span> <span m="457000">not fuss because I don't want to have an extra a floating around</span> <span m="462000">everywhere just contributing nothing but a mild confusion to</span> <span m="465000">the proceedings. So x1 prime,</span> <span m="467000">I am going to take a equal 1 and simply write it minus 2 x1</span> <span m="471000">plus x2 plus x3.</span> <span m="474000">And so now what would the equation for x2 prime</span> <span m="477000">be? Well, here x2 plays the role</span> <span m="481000">that x1 played before. And the only way to tell that</span> <span m="485000">x1 was the main guy here was it occurred with a coefficient</span> <span m="490000">negative 2, whereas, the other guys occurred with</span> <span m="494000">coefficient 1. That must be what happens here,</span> <span m="498000">too. Since x2 prime is our</span> <span m="501000">main man, this is minus x2 and this must be x1 here plus x3.</span> <span m="506000">And finally the last one is no different, x3 prime is x1 plus</span> <span m="511000">x2. And now it is the x3 that</span> <span m="515000">should get negative 2 for the coefficient.</span> <span m="518000">There is a perfectly reasonable-looking set of</span> <span m="522000">equations. Just how reasonable they are</span> <span m="525000">depends upon what their characteristic polynomial turns</span> <span m="529000">out to be. And all the work in these</span> <span m="532000">problems is trying to find nice models where you won't have to</span> <span m="537000">use Matlab to calculate the roots, the eigenvalues,</span> <span m="541000">the roots of the characteristic polynomial.</span> <span m="546000">So we have to now find the characteristic polynomial.</span> <span m="549000">The matrix that we are talking about is the matrix,</span> <span m="553000">well, let's right away write A minus lambda I</span> <span m="557000">I cannot use the trace and</span> <span m="559000">determinant form for this equation because it is not a</span> <span m="563000">two-by-two matrix. It is a three-by-three matrix.</span> <span m="566000">I have to use the original form for the characteristic equation.</span> <span m="572000">But what is this going to be? Well, what is A?</span> <span m="575000">A is minus 2. I am going to leave a little</span> <span m="578000">space here. 1, 1, 1 minus 2,</span> <span m="581000">1. And finally 1,</span> <span m="582000">1, negative 2. subtract lambda from</span> <span m="588000">the main diagonal, minus 2 minus lambda</span> <span m="592000">minus 2 minus lambda, minus 2 minus lambda.</span> <span m="596000">And now that equals zero is the characteristic equation.</span> <span m="602000">The term with the most lambdas in it is the main diagonal.</span> <span m="606000">That is always true, notice.</span> <span m="608000">Now, each of these I would be happier writing lambda plus 2,</span> <span m="612000">so there would be a negative sign, negative sign,</span> <span m="616000">negative sign. The product of three negative</span> <span m="619000">signs is still a negative sign because three is an odd number.</span> <span m="624000">So it is minus the principle term.</span> <span m="628000">The product of these three is minus lambda plus 2 cubed.</span> <span m="632000">Now, the rest of the terms are</span> <span m="636000">going to be easy. There is another term 1 times 1</span> <span m="640000">times 1, another term 1 times 1 times 1.</span> <span m="643000">So to that I add 2, 1 and 1 for those two other</span> <span m="647000">terms. And now I have the three going</span> <span m="649000">in this direction, but each one of them has to be</span> <span m="653000">prefaced with a minus sign. What does each one of them come</span> <span m="658000">to? Well, this is minus 2 minus</span> <span m="661000">lambda when I multiply those three numbers together.</span> <span m="665000">And so are the other guys. This is 1 times 1 times minus 2</span> <span m="669000">minus lambda, the same thing.</span> <span m="671000">There are three of them. Minus because they are going</span> <span m="675000">this way, minus 3 because there are three of them,</span> <span m="678000">and what each one of them is is negative 2 negative lambda.</span> <span m="682000">That is equal to zero, and that is the characteristic</span> <span m="686000">equation. Now, it doesn't look very</span> <span m="689000">promising. On the other hand,</span> <span m="691000">I have selected it for the lecture.</span> <span m="693000">Simple psychology should tell you that it is going to come out</span> <span m="697000">okay. What I am going to do is expand</span> <span m="699000">this. First imagine changing the</span> <span m="701000">sign. I hate to have a minus sign in</span> <span m="704000">front of a lambda cubed,</span> <span m="706000">so let's make this plus and we will make this minus and we will</span> <span m="710000">make this plus. I will just change all the</span> <span m="712000">signs, which is okay since it is an equation equals zero.</span> <span m="716000">That doesn't change its roots any.</span> <span m="720000">And now we are going to expand it out.</span> <span m="722000">What is this? Lambda plus 2 cubed.</span> <span m="725000">Lambda cubed plus,</span> <span m="726000">and don't get confused because it is this 2 that will kill you</span> <span m="730000">when you use the binomial theorem.</span> <span m="732000">If there is 1 here everybody knows what to do.</span> <span m="735000">If there is an A there everybody knows what to do.</span> <span m="738000">It is when that is a number not 1 that everybody makes mistakes,</span> <span m="742000">including me. The binomial coefficients are</span> <span m="745000">1, 3, 3, 1 because it is a cubed, I am expanding.</span> <span m="750000">So it is lambda cubed plus 3 times lambda squared times 2.</span> <span m="754000">I won't explain to you what I am doing.</span> <span m="757000">I will just do it and hope that you all know what I am doing.</span> <span m="761000">Plus 3 times lambda times 2 squared plus the last term,</span> <span m="765000">which is 2 cubed.</span> <span m="769000">And now we have the other term.</span> <span m="773000">All that is plus because I changed its sign.</span> <span m="776000">The next thing is negative 2. And then the last thing is plus</span> <span m="783000">3 times (minus 2 minus lambda).</span> <span m="788000">Let's keep it. So what is the actual</span> <span m="791000">characteristic equation? Maybe I can finish it.</span> <span m="795000">I should stay over here instead of recopying all of it.</span> <span m="807000">Well, there is a lot more work to do.</span> <span m="809000">Let's see if we can at least write down the equation.</span> <span m="813000">What is it? It is lambda cubed.</span> <span m="815000">What is the lambda squared</span> <span m="818000">erm? It is six and that is all there</span> <span m="822000">is. How about the lambda term?</span> <span m="824000">Well, we have 12 lambda minus 3 lambda which makes plus 9</span> <span m="828000">lambda. That looks good but constant</span> <span m="831000">terms have a way of screwing everything up.</span> <span m="834000">What is the constant term? It is A minus 2 minus 6.</span> <span m="840000">Zero. The constant term is zero.</span> <span m="842000">That converts this from a hard problem to an easy problem.</span> <span m="847000">Now it is a cinch to calculate the stuff.</span> <span m="851000">Let's go to this board and continue the work over here.</span> <span m="864000">The equation is lambda cubed plus 6 lambda squared plus 9</span> <span m="867000">lambda is zero.</span> <span m="871000">It is very easy to calculate the roots of that.</span> <span m="874000">You factor it. Lambda is a common factor.</span> <span m="877000">And what is left? Lambda squared plus 6 lambda</span> <span m="880000">plus 9.</span> <span m="883000">That is the sort of thing you got all the time when you were</span> <span m="887000">studying critical damping. It is the square of lambda plus</span> <span m="891000">3. Lambda squared plus 6 lambda</span> <span m="894000">plus 9 equals zero. So the eigenvalues,</span> <span m="898000">the roots are what? Well, they are lambda equals</span> <span m="902000">zero from this factor and then lambda equals minus 3.</span> <span m="907000">But what is new is that the</span> <span m="910000">minus 3 is a double root. That is a double root.</span> <span m="914000">Now, that, of course, is what is going to cause the</span> <span m="918000">trouble. Because, for each one of these,</span> <span m="921000">I am supposed to calculate the eigenvector and make up the</span> <span m="926000">solution. But that assumed that I had</span> <span m="929000">three things to get three different solutions.</span> <span m="932000">Here I have only got two things.</span> <span m="934000">It is the same trouble we ran into when there was a repeated</span> <span m="938000">root. We were studying second or</span> <span m="940000">third order differential equations and the characteristic</span> <span m="943000">equation had a repeated root. And I had to go into a song and</span> <span m="947000">dance and stand on my head and multiply things by t and so on.</span> <span m="951000">And then talk very hard arguing why that was a good thing to do</span> <span m="954000">to get the answer. Now, I am not going to do the</span> <span m="957000">same thing here. Instead, I am going to try to</span> <span m="962000">solve the problem instead. Let's get two points by at</span> <span m="966000">least doing the easy part of it. Lambda equals zero.</span> <span m="971000">What am I supposed to do with</span> <span m="973000">lambda equals zero? I am looking for the alpha that</span> <span m="977000">goes with that. And I find that eigenvector by</span> <span m="981000">solving this system of equations.</span> <span m="984000">Let's write out what that system of equations is.</span> <span m="989000">Well, if lambda is zero, this isn't there.</span> <span m="992000">It is just the matrix A times alpha equals zero.</span> <span m="998000">And the matrix A is,</span> <span m="1000000">I never even wrote it anywhere. I never wrote A.</span> <span m="1005000">I thought I would get away without having to do it,</span> <span m="1009000">but you never get away with anything.</span> <span m="1013000">It's the principle of life. That is A.</span> <span m="1018000">If I subtract zero from the main diagonal,</span> <span m="1021000">that doesn't do a great deal to A.</span> <span m="1024000">And the resulting system of equations is those same things,</span> <span m="1030000">except you have the a1's there, too.</span> <span m="1033000">There is one. a1 minus 2 a2 plus a3 equals</span> <span m="1037000">zero. I am just subtracting zero from</span> <span m="1042000">the main diagonal so there is nothing to do.</span> <span m="1046000">a2 minus 2 a3 equals zero. Now I am supposed to solve</span> <span m="1053000">those.</span> <span m="1060000">Of course we could do it. Well, how do you know how to</span> <span m="1063000">solve a system of three linear equations?</span> <span m="1065000">Well, elimination. You can always solve by</span> <span m="1068000">elimination. Now we are much more</span> <span m="1070000">sophisticated than that. You all have pocket calculators</span> <span m="1074000">so you could use the inverse matrix, right?</span> <span m="1076000">No. You cannot use the inverse</span> <span m="1078000">matrix. What will happen if you punch</span> <span m="1083000">in those coefficients and then punch in A inverse.</span> <span m="1088000">What answer will it give you? 0, 0, 0.</span> <span m="1092000">No, I am sorry. It won't give you any answer.</span> <span m="1096000">What will it say? It will say I cannot calculate</span> <span m="1101000">the inverse to that matrix because the whole purpose of</span> <span m="1107000">this exercise was to find a value of lambda such that this</span> <span m="1113000">system of equations is dependent.</span> <span m="1118000">The coefficient determinant is zero and, therefore,</span> <span m="1122000">the coefficient matrix does not have an inverse matrix.</span> <span m="1126000">You cannot use that method. In other words,</span> <span m="1129000">the inverse matrix will never work in these problems because</span> <span m="1134000">the system of equations you will be trying to solve is always a</span> <span m="1139000">non-independent system. And, therefore,</span> <span m="1143000">its determinant is always zero. And, therefore,</span> <span m="1146000">there is no inverse matrix because the determinant of the</span> <span m="1151000">coefficient is zero. All you can do is use</span> <span m="1154000">elimination or physical insight and common sense.</span> <span m="1158000">Now, because I teach differential equations everybody</span> <span m="1163000">assumes, mistakenly, as I think, that I really know</span> <span m="1167000">something about them. I get now and then graduate</span> <span m="1172000">students, not in mathematics, but some obscure field of</span> <span m="1176000">engineering or whatever drift into my office and say I see you</span> <span m="1180000">teach differential equations. Do you have a minute here?</span> <span m="1185000">And before I can say no they write their differential</span> <span m="1189000">equation on the board. And almost invariably it is</span> <span m="1192000">nothing I have ever seen before. And they so look at me</span> <span m="1197000">hopefully and expectantly. So what do I ask them?</span> <span m="1201000">I don't ask them what they have tried.</span> <span m="1205000">What I ask them is where did this come from?</span> <span m="1208000">What field did it come from? Because each field has its own</span> <span m="1214000">little tricks. It gets the same differential</span> <span m="1217000">equations all the time and has its own little tricks for</span> <span m="1222000">solving them. You should do the same thing</span> <span m="1226000">here. Well, of course we can solve</span> <span m="1229000">this. And by now most of you have</span> <span m="1233000">solved it just by inspection, just by sort of psyching out</span> <span m="1237000">the answer. But a better way is to say</span> <span m="1240000">look, suppose we had the solution, what would the</span> <span m="1244000">solution look like? Well, it would look like (a1,</span> <span m="1248000">a2, a3), whatever the values of those variables were which gave</span> <span m="1252000">me the solution to the equation, times e to the 0t.</span> <span m="1257000">But what is this? e to the 0t is one</span> <span m="1262000">for all time. And, therefore,</span> <span m="1264000">this is a constant solution. What I am asking is to find a</span> <span m="1269000">constant solution. Now, can I, by inspection,</span> <span m="1273000">find a constant solution to this?</span> <span m="1275000">If so it must be the one. Well, there is an obvious</span> <span m="1279000">constant solution. All the cells have the same</span> <span m="1283000">temperature. If that is true then there is</span> <span m="1286000">no reason why it should ever change as time goes on.</span> <span m="1292000">The physical problem itself suggests what the answer must</span> <span m="1295000">be. You don't have to solve</span> <span m="1297000">equations. In other words,</span> <span m="1298000">any constant like (1, 1, 1).</span> <span m="1300000">Well, could it be (20, 20, 20)?</span> <span m="1302000">Yeah, that is a constant multiple of (1,</span> <span m="1304000">1, 1). That is included.</span> <span m="1305000">My basic constant solution, therefore, is simply (1,</span> <span m="1308000">1, 1) times e to the 0t.</span> <span m="1311000">You don't have to include e to the 0t because it is one.</span> <span m="1314000">Now, just to check, is (1, 1, 1) a solution to</span> <span m="1317000">these equations? It certainly is.</span> <span m="1321000">1 plus 1 minus 2 is zero in every case.</span> <span m="1324000">The equations are essentially the same, except they use</span> <span m="1328000">different variables. By inspection or,</span> <span m="1331000">if you like, by elimination,</span> <span m="1334000">but not by finding the inverse matrix you solve those</span> <span m="1338000">equations. And we have our first solution.</span> <span m="1341000">Now let's go onto the second one.</span> <span m="1344000">For the second one, we are going to have to use the</span> <span m="1348000">eigenvalue lambda equals negative 3.</span> <span m="1353000">And now what is the system of equations?</span> <span m="1356000">Well, now I have to take this and I have to subtract negative</span> <span m="1361000">3 from the diagonal elements. Minus 2 minus negative 3 is</span> <span m="1366000">plus 1, right?</span> <span m="1369000">Got that? Each of the diagonal elements,</span> <span m="1373000">after I subtract minus 3 turns into plus 1.</span> <span m="1378000">And, therefore, the system becomes,</span> <span m="1380000">the system I have to solve is a1 plus a2 plus a3 equals zero.</span> <span m="1385000">And what is the second</span> <span m="1389000">equation? Symmetry is preserved.</span> <span m="1391000">All the equations are essentially the same,</span> <span m="1394000">except for the names of the variables so they all must give</span> <span m="1399000">you the same thing after I subtract minus 3 from the main</span> <span m="1404000">diagonal. Well, that is what we call a</span> <span m="1407000">dependent system of equations. All I have is the same equation</span> <span m="1414000">repeated twice, but I still have to solve it.</span> <span m="1418000">Now, what you see is that there are lots of solutions to this.</span> <span m="1424000">Let me write down one of them. For example,</span> <span m="1429000">suppose I made a1 equal to 1 and I made a2 a 0,</span> <span m="1434000">then a3 would be negative 1.</span> <span m="1440000">So here is a solution. That is the eigenvector.</span> <span m="1443000">And with it, I can make the solution by</span> <span m="1446000">multiplying by e to the negative 3t.</span> <span m="1450000">There is a solution. But that is not the only alpha</span> <span m="1454000">I could have chosen. Suppose I chose this one</span> <span m="1458000">instead. Suppose I kept this 1,</span> <span m="1460000">but this time made a3 zero. Well, in that case,</span> <span m="1464000">there would be a2 that had to be minus 1.</span> <span m="1470000">Now, is this essentially different from that one?</span> <span m="1472000">It would still be multiplied by e to the minus 3t,</span> <span m="1476000">but don't be fooled by the e to the minus 3t.</span> <span m="1479000">That is our scalar. That is not what is essential.</span> <span m="1482000">What is essential is the content of these two vectors.</span> <span m="1485000">Is either one a multiple of the other?</span> <span m="1487000">The answer is no. Therefore, they are</span> <span m="1489000">independent. They are pointing in two</span> <span m="1491000">different directions in three space, these two vectors.</span> <span m="1496000">And, therefore, I have two independent</span> <span m="1499000">solutions just by picking two different vectors that solve</span> <span m="1503000">those three equations. This is also a solution.</span> <span m="1507000">If I call this the eigenvector alpha 1, then I ought to call</span> <span m="1512000">this one the alpha 2. Hey, we can keep on going</span> <span m="1516000">through this. Why not make the first one</span> <span m="1519000">zero? Well, what would happen if I</span> <span m="1521000">made the first one 0, and then 1, and minus 1?</span> <span m="1525000">The answer is this one is no longer independent of those two.</span> <span m="1532000">I can get it by taking a combination of those two.</span> <span m="1534000">Do you see what combination I should take?</span> <span m="1542000">This one minus that one. This guy minus that guy gives</span> <span m="1547000">me that guy, isn't that right? 1 minus 1, 0 minus minus 1,</span> <span m="1552000">minus 1 minus 0. This is not a new one.</span> <span m="1556000">It looks new, but it is not.</span> <span m="1560000">I can get it by taking a linear combination of these two.</span> <span m="1564000">It is not independent delta. And that would be true for any</span> <span m="1568000">other possible solution you could get for these equations.</span> <span m="1572000">Once you found two solutions, all the others will be linear</span> <span m="1576000">combinations of them. Well, I cannot use that one.</span> <span m="1580000">It is not new. And the general solution,</span> <span m="1583000">therefore, will be a combination, c1 times that one</span> <span m="1586000">plus a constant times this one. Plus the first one that I found</span> <span m="1592000">c3 times (1, 1, 1) e to the 0t,</span> <span m="1596000">which I don't have to write in. That is the general solution to</span> <span m="1602000">the system, (x1,x2, x3).</span> <span m="1605000">What happens as time goes to infinity?</span> <span m="1608000">Regardless of what the values of these two C's this term goes</span> <span m="1614000">to zero, that term goes to zero and what I am left with is a</span> <span m="1620000">constant solution. So all of these solutions tend</span> <span m="1626000">to be the solution where all the cells are at the same</span> <span m="1631000">temperature. Well, of course there must be</span> <span m="1635000">some vocabulary word in this. There is.</span> <span m="1639000">There are two vocabulary words. This is a good eigenvalue.</span> <span m="1645000">There are also bad eigenvalues. This is a good repeated</span> <span m="1652000">eigenvalue, but good is not the official word.</span> <span m="1657000">An eigenvalue like this, which is repeated but where you</span> <span m="1664000">can find enough eigenvectors, if lambda is a repeated</span> <span m="1670000">eigenvalue, it occurs multiply in the characteristic polynomial</span> <span m="1677000">as a root. But you can find enough</span> <span m="1683000">independent eigenvectors -- Forget the "but."</span> <span m="1710000">-- to make up the needed number of independent solutions.</span> <span m="1716000">For example, if it is repeated once,</span> <span m="1720000">that is it occurs doubly then somehow I have got to get two</span> <span m="1726000">solutions out of that as I was able to here.</span> <span m="1731000">If it occurred triply, I have got to get three</span> <span m="1736000">solutions out of it. I would look for three</span> <span m="1742000">independent eigenvectors and hope I could find them.</span> <span m="1746000">That is the good case because it tells you how to make up as</span> <span m="1752000">many solutions as you need. And this kind of eigenvalue is</span> <span m="1757000">called in the literature the complete eigenvalue.</span> <span m="1770000">Now, how about the kind in which you cannot?</span> <span m="1773000">Well, unfortunately, all my life I have called it</span> <span m="1777000">incomplete, which seems to be a perfectly reasonable thing to</span> <span m="1783000">call it. However, terminology changes</span> <span m="1786000">slowly over time. The notes, because I wrote</span> <span m="1790000">them, call it an incomplete eigenvalue.</span> <span m="1793000">But the accepted term nowadays is defective.</span> <span m="1797000">I don't like that. It violates the "eigenvalues</span> <span m="1802000">with disabilities act" or something.</span> <span m="1806000">But I have to give it to you because that is the word I am</span> <span m="1811000">going to try to use from now on, at least if I remember to use</span> <span m="1818000">it. It would be the word,</span> <span m="1820000">for example, used in the linear algebra</span> <span m="1824000">course 18.06 "plug, plug," defective otherwise.</span> <span m="1830000">A defective eigenvalue is one where you can get one</span> <span m="1833000">eigenvector. If it is double,</span> <span m="1834000">for example, if it a double eigenvalue.</span> <span m="1837000">It is defective if you can get one eigenvector that goes with</span> <span m="1841000">it, but you cannot find an independent one.</span> <span m="1843000">The only other ones you can find are multiples of the first</span> <span m="1847000">one. Then you are really in trouble</span> <span m="1849000">because you just don't have enough solutions that you are</span> <span m="1853000">supposed to get out of that, and you have to do something.</span> <span m="1858000">What you do is turn to problem two on your problem set and</span> <span m="1861000">solve it because that tells you what to do.</span> <span m="1864000">And I even give you an example to work.</span> <span m="1866000">Problem two, that little matrix has a</span> <span m="1869000">defective eigenvalue. It doesn't look defective,</span> <span m="1872000">but you cannot tell. It is defective.</span> <span m="1874000">But you, nonetheless, will be able to find two</span> <span m="1877000">solutions because you will be following instructions.</span> <span m="1892000">Now, the only other thing I should tell you is one of the</span> <span m="1895000">most important theorems in linear algebra,</span> <span m="1897000">which is totally beyond the scope of this course and is</span> <span m="1901000">beyond the scope of most elementary linear algebra</span> <span m="1904000">courses as I have taught around the country but,</span> <span m="1907000">of course, not at MIT. But, nonetheless,</span> <span m="1909000">it is the last theorem in the course.</span> <span m="1911000">That means it is liable to use stuff.</span> <span m="1913000">The theorem goes by different names.</span> <span m="1915000">Sometimes it is called the principle axis theorem.</span> <span m="1920000">Sometimes it is called the spectral theorem.</span> <span m="1924000">But, anyway, what it says is,</span> <span m="1926000">if A is a real end-by-end matrix which is symmetric,</span> <span m="1931000">you know what a symmetric matrix is?</span> <span m="1935000">The formal definition is it is equal to its transpose.</span> <span m="1940000">What that means is if you flip it around the main diagonal it</span> <span m="1945000">looks just the same as before. Somewhere on this board,</span> <span m="1952000">right there, in fact, is a symmetric matrix.</span> <span m="1956000">What happened to it? Right here was the symmetric</span> <span m="1960000">matrix. I erased the one thing which I</span> <span m="1964000">had to have. Minus 2, 1, 1;</span> <span m="1966000">1, minus 2, 1; 1, 1 minus 2.</span> <span m="1971000">That was our matrix A. The matrix is symmetric because</span> <span m="1977000">if I flip it around the diagonal it looks the same as it did</span> <span m="1982000">before. Well, not exactly.</span> <span m="1986000">The ones are sort of lying on their side, but you have to take</span> <span m="1990000">account of that. Is that right?</span> <span m="1992000">The twos are backward. Well, you know what I mean.</span> <span m="1995000">Put that element there, this one here,</span> <span m="1998000">that one there. Exchange these two.</span> <span m="2000000">Notice the diagonal elements don't all have to be minus 2 for</span> <span m="2004000">that. No matter what they were,</span> <span m="2006000">they are the guys that aren't moved when you do the flipping.</span> <span m="2012000">Therefore, there is no condition on them.</span> <span m="2014000">It is these other guys. Each guy here has to use the</span> <span m="2018000">same guy there. This one has to be the same as</span> <span m="2022000">that one, and so on. Then it will be real and</span> <span m="2025000">symmetric. If you have a matrix that is</span> <span m="2028000">real and symmetric, like the one we have been</span> <span m="2031000">working with, the theorem is that all its</span> <span m="2034000">eigenvalues are complete. That is a very unobvious</span> <span m="2038000">theorem. All its eigenvalues are</span> <span m="2042000">automatically complete. And it is a remarkable fact</span> <span m="2047000">that you can prove that purely generally with a certain amount</span> <span m="2054000">of pure reasoning no calculation at all.</span> <span m="2058000">But it has to be true, and it is true.</span> <span m="2062000">You will find there are whole branches of applied differential</span> <span m="2068000">equations. You know, equilibrium theory,</span> <span m="2073000">all the matrices that you deal with are always symmetric.</span> <span m="2077000">And, therefore, this repeated eigenvalues is</span> <span m="2080000">not something you have to worry about, finding extra solutions.</span> <span m="2085000">Well, I guess that is the end of the first part of the</span> <span m="2089000">lecture. I have a third of it left.</span> <span m="2092000">Let's talk fast. I would like to,</span> <span m="2095000">with the remaining time, explain to you what to do if</span> <span m="2099000">you were to get complex eigenvalues.</span> <span m="2108000">Now, actually, the answer is follow the same</span> <span m="2111000">program. In other words,</span> <span m="2112000">if you solve the characteristic equation and you get a complex</span> <span m="2117000">root, follow the program, calculate the corresponding</span> <span m="2120000">complex eigenvectors. In other words,</span> <span m="2123000">solve the equations. Everything will be the same</span> <span m="2126000">except that the eigenvectors will turn out to be complex,</span> <span m="2130000">that is will have complex entries.</span> <span m="2134000">Don't worry about it. Then form the solutions.</span> <span m="2137000">The solutions are now going to look once again like alpha times</span> <span m="2143000">e to the a plus bi to the t.</span> <span m="2147000">This will be complex and that will be complex,</span> <span m="2151000">too. This will have complex entries.</span> <span m="2154000">And then, finally, take the real and imaginary</span> <span m="2158000">parts. Those will be real and they</span> <span m="2162000">will give real and two solutions.</span> <span m="2164000">In other words, the program is exactly like</span> <span m="2168000">what we did for second-order differential equations.</span> <span m="2172000">We used the complex numbers, got complex solutions.</span> <span m="2176000">And then, at the very last step, we took the real and</span> <span m="2180000">imaginary parts to get two real solutions out of each complex</span> <span m="2185000">number. I would like to give you a</span> <span m="2187000">simple example of working that out.</span> <span m="2190000">And it is the system x prime equals x plus 2y.</span> <span m="2195000">And y prime equals minus x</span> <span m="2199000">minus y. Because it is springtime,</span> <span m="2205000">it doesn't feel like spring but it will this weekend as it is</span> <span m="2211000">getting warmer. And since, when I am too tired</span> <span m="2216000">to make up problem sets for you late at night,</span> <span m="2221000">I watch reruns of Seinfeld. I am from New York.</span> <span m="2226000">It is just in my bloodstream. Of course, the most interesting</span> <span m="2232000">character on Seinfeld is George. We are going to consider Susan</span> <span m="2239000">who is the girlfriend who got killed by licking poison</span> <span m="2244000">envelopes. And George carried on their</span> <span m="2248000">love affair until Susan was disposed of by the writers by</span> <span m="2253000">this strange death. And we are going to consider x</span> <span m="2259000">is modeling Susan's love for George.</span> <span m="2263000">That is x. And George's love for Susan</span> <span m="2267000">will be y. Now, I don't mean the absolute</span> <span m="2271000">love. If x and y are zero,</span> <span m="2273000">I don't mean that they don't love each other.</span> <span m="2278000">I just mean that that is the equilibrium value of the love.</span> <span m="2285000">Everything else is measured as departures from that.</span> <span m="2290000">So (0, 0) represents the normal amount of love,</span> <span m="2295000">if love is measured. I don't know what love units</span> <span m="2300000">are. Hearts, I guess.</span> <span m="2302000">Six hearts, let's say. Now, in what sense does this</span> <span m="2307000">model it? This is a normal equation and</span> <span m="2312000">this is a neurotic equation. That is why this is George and</span> <span m="2316000">this is Susan who seemed very normal to me.</span> <span m="2319000">Susan is a normal person. When y is positive that means</span> <span m="2323000">that George seems to be loving her more today than yesterday,</span> <span m="2327000">and her natural response is to be more in love with him.</span> <span m="2331000">That is what most people are. If y is negative,</span> <span m="2334000">hey, what's the matter with George?</span> <span m="2337000">He doesn't feel so good. Maybe there is something wrong</span> <span m="2342000">with him. She gets a little mad at him</span> <span m="2346000">and this goes down. x prime is negative.</span> <span m="2350000">And the same way why is this positive?</span> <span m="2353000">Well, again, it is a psychological thing,</span> <span m="2357000">but all the world loves a lover.</span> <span m="2360000">When Susan is in love, as she feels x is high,</span> <span m="2364000">that makes her feel good. And she loves everything,</span> <span m="2368000">in fact. Not just George.</span> <span m="2372000">It is one of those things. You all know what I am talking</span> <span m="2378000">about. Now, George,</span> <span m="2380000">of course, is what makes the writers happy.</span> <span m="2384000">George is neurotic and, therefore, is exactly the</span> <span m="2389000">opposite. He sees one day that he feels</span> <span m="2393000">more in love with Susan than he was yesterday.</span> <span m="2400000">Does this make him happy? Not at all.</span> <span m="2402000">Not at all. It makes y prime more negative.</span> <span m="2405000">Why? Because all he can think of is,</span> <span m="2408000">my God, suppose I am really in love with this girl?</span> <span m="2411000">Suppose I marry her. Oh, my God, 40 years of seeing</span> <span m="2415000">the same person at breakfast all the time.</span> <span m="2418000">I must be crazy. And so it goes down.</span> <span m="2420000">Here is our neurotic model. The question for differential</span> <span m="2424000">equations is, what do the solutions to that</span> <span m="2427000">look like? In other words,</span> <span m="2431000">how does, in fact, their love affair go?</span> <span m="2434000">Now, there is a reason why the writers picked that model,</span> <span m="2439000">as you will see. It means they were able to get</span> <span m="2444000">a year's worth of episodes out of it.</span> <span m="2447000">And why is that so? Well, let's solve it.</span> <span m="2450000">The characteristic equation is lambda squared.</span> <span m="2454000">The matrix that governs this system is A equals (1,</span> <span m="2459000">2; negative 1, negative 1)</span> <span m="2462000">The trace of that matrix,</span> <span m="2466000">the sum of the diagonal elements is zero.</span> <span m="2470000">There is the zero lambda here. The determinant,</span> <span m="2473000">which is the constant term, is negative 1,</span> <span m="2476000">minus negative 2, which is plus 1.</span> <span m="2479000">So the characteristic equation, by calculating the trace and</span> <span m="2483000">determinant is lambda squared plus 1 equals 0.</span> <span m="2488000">The eigenvalues are plus and</span> <span m="2492000">minus i. Now, you don't have to pick</span> <span m="2495000">both of them because the negative one lead to essentially</span> <span m="2500000">the same solutions but with negative signs.</span> <span m="2504000">Either one will do just as we solved second order equations.</span> <span m="2509000">The system for finding the eigenvectors,</span> <span m="2513000">well, we are going to have to accept the complex eigenvector.</span> <span m="2520000">What is the system going to be? Well, I take the matrix and I</span> <span m="2525000">subtract i. We will use i.</span> <span m="2527000">Subtract i from the main diagonal.</span> <span m="2530000">So the system is (1 minus i) times a1 plus 2a2 is zero.</span> <span m="2535000">And let's, for good measure,</span> <span m="2539000">write the other one down, too.</span> <span m="2542000">It is negative a1 plus minus (1 minus i) times a2.</span> <span m="2548000">Then what is the solution?</span> <span m="2553000">Well, you get the solution the usual way.</span> <span m="2559000">Let's take a1 equal to 1.</span> <span m="2564000">Then what is a2? a2 is 1 minus i divided by 2</span> <span m="2570000">from the first equation.</span> <span m="2578000">So the complex solution is 1 minus i over 2 times</span> <span m="2582000">e to the it. Now you have to take the real</span> <span m="2585000">and imaginary parts of that. This is the only part which</span> <span m="2589000">technically I would not trust you to do without having someone</span> <span m="2593000">show you how to do it. What do you do?</span> <span m="2595000">Well, of course, you know how to separate the</span> <span m="2598000">real and imaginary parts of that.</span> <span m="2600000">It is the first thing is to separate the vectors.</span> <span m="2605000">I don't know how to explain this.</span> <span m="2609000">Just watch. The real part of it is 1,</span> <span m="2613000">one-half. It should be negative 1,</span> <span m="2617000">so minus this plus that because I didn't put that on the right</span> <span m="2625000">side. It is minus one-half plus i</span> <span m="2629000">times (0, one-half).</span> <span m="2634000">Anybody want to fight?</span> <span m="2640000">1 plus i times 0 minus one-half plus one-half times i.</span> <span m="2646000">You saw how I did that? Okay.</span> <span m="2650000">When you do these problem you do it the same way,</span> <span m="2656000">but don't ask me to explain what I just did.</span> <span m="2661000">Here it is cosine t plus i sine t.</span> <span m="2670000">And so the real part will give me one solution.</span> <span m="2674000">The imaginary part will give me another.</span> <span m="2679000">Since I have a limited amount of time, let's just calculate</span> <span m="2685000">the real part. What is it?</span> <span m="2688000">Well, it is (1, minus Â½) times cosine t,</span> <span m="2692000">i squared is negative 1, so minus (0,</span> <span m="2696000">one-half), the negative 1 from the i squared,</span> <span m="2701000">times sine t.</span> <span m="2704000">Now, what solution is that?</span> <span m="2710000">This is (x, y). Take the final step.</span> <span m="2713000">It doesn't have to look like that.</span> <span m="2716000">x equals cosine t.</span> <span m="2719000">Do you see that? x equals cosine t plus 0 times</span> <span m="2724000">sine t.</span> <span m="2727000">What is y? y is minus one-half times</span> <span m="2731000">cosine t, minus one-half times sine t, plus sine t.</span> <span m="2737000">Now, you may have the pleasure</span> <span m="2742000">of showing eliminating t. You get a quadratic polynomial</span> <span m="2747000">in x and y equals zero. This is an ellipse.</span> <span m="2751000">As t varies, you can see this repeats its</span> <span m="2755000">values at intervals of 2pi, this gives an ellipse.</span> <span m="2761000">And if you want to use a little computer program,</span> <span m="2765000">linear phase, this is not in the assignment,</span> <span m="2769000">but the ellipses look like this and go around that way.</span> <span m="2774000">And that is the model of George and Susan's love.</span> <span m="2779000">x, Susan. y, George.</span> <span m="2781000">They go round and round in this little love circle,</span> <span m="2785000">and it stretches on for 26 episodes.</span> </p>
