00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,270
PROFESSOR: Welcome
in this recitation.

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,240
So we're going to talk about
linear systems of equations.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,790
So in the first question, we
are given a system of equations.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,290
x dot equals 6x plus 5y.

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,660
y dot equals x plus 2y.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,350
We're asked to write this
system in matrix form.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,820
The second part asks us to
convert a differential equation

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,119
of second order, x dot dot
plus 8x dot plus 7x equals

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,710
to zero into matrix form,
basically into system of ODEs,

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,300
similar to the first part.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,790
In the third part
of the problem,

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,540
we're asked to
interpret the population

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,820
model x dot equals 2x minus
3y, y dot equals x minus y.

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,380
So here, x and y are modeling
either a prey or predator.

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,110
And you're asked to think
about the interpretation

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,060
of the system to
determine which of x or y

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,630
is the prey or the predator.

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,140
So why don't you
take a few minutes?

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,570
Think about these
three questions,

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,528
and I'll be right back.

21
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,900
Welcome back.

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,120
So for the first
question, basically, we're

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,460
asked to write this
system in matrix form.

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,110
So we have [x, y] derivative
for that left-hand side.

25
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,950
You need to write this in the
form of a matrix multiplying

26
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,920
x and y.

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:42,550
So here, we would
have 6, 5; 1, 2.

28
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,360
And that would be our system
of differential equations

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,760
in matrix form.

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,010
And what we would be solving
for would be the vector [x, y].

31
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,850
The second part of the problem,
we need to do the opposite,

32
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:02,780
go from the second order
differential equation

33
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,450
into matrix form.

34
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:12,020
So to do that, we introduced a
new variable, y equals x dot.

35
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,923
And from that point,
we can then write

36
00:02:15,923 --> 00:02:19,490
x dot dot-- so if I'm going to
just start with what we know

37
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:24,570
about the equation,
x dot dot equals--

38
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,540
let me write it in a
system first before I do it

39
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,450
in a vector form.

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,790
We would write x dot dot
equals minus 7x minus 8x dot.

41
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,760
But we introduced a new
variable x dot equals 2y.

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,630
So we have minus 7x minus 8y.

43
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,310
So now, the other
equation we need

44
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,050
is the one that tells
us what this y is.

45
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,940
So we have x dot equals to
y, which is the new variable

46
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,200
that we introduced here.

47
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,570
And so we go from a second-order
differential equation

48
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,740
into a system of two
differential equations that we

49
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,760
can write now in vectorial
form, in matrix form,

50
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:15,200
like we did for the first part,
as x, x dot which is just y--

51
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,550
I'm just going to
write this like this,

52
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:27,420
it's just from what we defined--
equals to, again, [x, y],

53
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,330
like we did previously.

54
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,360
And now we have to
read off our system

55
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,690
to find the coefficient
of this matrix.

56
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,740
So x dot equals to
y means that there

57
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:43,690
is zero coefficient in front of
the x, a 1 in front of the y.

58
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,380
x dot dot equals minus 7x.

59
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,440
So we will have a minus 7
multiplying the x and minus 8

60
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,190
multiplying the y.

61
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,500
And so that's how we convert
a differential equation,

62
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,070
second order, into the systems
of differential equations

63
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,096
in matrix form.

64
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:04,970
And this matrix would
be called, referred to,

65
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,480
the companion matrix of
this differential equation.

66
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,350
OK, so that ends
the second part.

67
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,970
So now for the third
question, we're

68
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:24,180
asked to interpret this
population dynamics

69
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,890
system of equation.

70
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:34,100
Minus 3y; y dot
equals x minus y.

71
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,220
So the question was,
we have two species.

72
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,300
Which one is the prey,
which one is the predator?

73
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,030
So how do we go about
figuring this out?

74
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,940
Let's look at how
x dot varies with y

75
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,070
or basically variable
x varies with y.

76
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,870
Here, we can see that we have
a coefficient that is minus 3.

77
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,190
It is negative, which means
that when y increases,

78
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,760
we have a more and more
negative x dot, which means

79
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,430
that the value of x goes down.

80
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,540
So as the population
y increases,

81
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,670
we have a decrease
of population x,

82
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,820
which suggests that y
is a predator eating up

83
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,720
population x.

84
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,140
And if you look at the equation
for y, we have x minus y.

85
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,430
And here, what we see is
that when x increases,

86
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,520
the population y then increases.

87
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,310
So that definitely
confirms that y

88
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,410
is our predator that
basically increases

89
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,050
by feeding on the population x.

90
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:35,845
And as it feeds on
population x, y increases,

91
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:38,470
which means that here this term
becomes more and more negative,

92
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,310
which means x decreases in turn.

93
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,780
And these two terms could
be modeling, for example,

94
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,190
here just the growth
of the population,

95
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,140
so birth term of the prey.

96
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,780
And these minus y here could
be just modeling, for example,

97
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,340
a death rate of these predators.

98
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:01,000
And so we have x
prey and y predator.

99
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,040
So from this
recitation, we learned

100
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,090
how to convert a system
of differential equations

101
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,430
to matrix form.

102
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,770
We learned how to convert
a second-order differential

103
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,320
equation into also
matrix form, or basically

104
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,130
system differential
equation, introducing

105
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,740
notion of companion matrix.

106
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,820
And we learned how to interpret
a system of differential

107
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,650
equations in terms of
what populations could it

108
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,040
be modeling or what dynamics
it could be modeling.

109
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,310
So that ends the recitation.
