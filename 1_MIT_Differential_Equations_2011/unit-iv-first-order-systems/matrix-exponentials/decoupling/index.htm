<p><span m="8000">Everything I say today is going to be for n-by-n systems,</span> <span m="12000">but for your calculations and the exams two-by-two will be</span> <span m="17000">good enough. Our system looks like that.</span> <span m="20000">Notice I am talking today about the homogeneous system,</span> <span m="25000">not the inhomogenous system. So, homogenous.</span> <span m="36000">And we have so far two basic methods of solving it.</span> <span m="40000">The first one, on which we spent the most</span> <span m="43000">time, is the method of where you calculate the eigenvalues of the</span> <span m="48000">matrix, the eigenvectors, and put them together to make</span> <span m="53000">the general solution. So eigenvalues,</span> <span m="56000">e-vectors and so on. The second method,</span> <span m="60000">which I gave you last time, I called "royal road," simply</span> <span m="64000">calculates the matrix e to the At and says that the</span> <span m="68000">solution is e to the At times x zero,</span> <span m="71000">the initial condition. That is very elegant.</span> <span m="74000">The only problem is that to calculate the matrix e to the</span> <span m="78000">At, although sometimes you can do it by its definition as an</span> <span m="82000">infinite series, most of the time the only way</span> <span m="86000">to calculate the matrix e to the At is by using the fundamental</span> <span m="90000">matrix. In other words,</span> <span m="93000">the normal way of doing it is you have to calculate it as the</span> <span m="97000">fundamental matrix time normalized at zero.</span> <span m="100000">So, as I explained at the end of last time and you practiced</span> <span m="104000">in the recitations, you have to find the</span> <span m="106000">fundamental matrix, which, of course,</span> <span m="109000">you have to do by eigenvalues and eigenvectors.</span> <span m="112000">And then you multiply it by its value at zero,</span> <span m="115000">inverse. And that, by magic,</span> <span m="117000">turns out to be the same as the exponential matrix.</span> <span m="122000">But, of course, there has been no gain in</span> <span m="125000">simplicity or no gain in ease of calculation.</span> <span m="128000">The only difference is that the language has been changed.</span> <span m="132000">Now, today is going to be devoted to yet another method</span> <span m="136000">which saves no work at all and only amounts to a change of</span> <span m="141000">language. The only reason I give it to</span> <span m="143000">you is because I have been begged by various engineering</span> <span m="148000">departments to do so -- -- because that is the language</span> <span m="153000">they use. In other words,</span> <span m="155000">each person who solves systems, some like to use fundamental</span> <span m="159000">matrices, some just calculate, some immediately convert the</span> <span m="164000">system by elimination into a single higher order equation</span> <span m="168000">because they are more comfortable with that.</span> <span m="172000">Some, especially if they are writing papers,</span> <span m="175000">they talk exponential matrices. But there are a certain number</span> <span m="181000">of engineers and scientists who talk decoupling,</span> <span m="185000">express the problem and the answer in terms of decoupling.</span> <span m="189000">And that is, therefore, what I have to</span> <span m="192000">explain to you today. So, the third method,</span> <span m="196000">today's method, I stress is really no more than</span> <span m="200000">a change of language. And I feel a little guilty</span> <span m="203000">about the whole business. Instead of going more deeply</span> <span m="209000">into studying these equations, what I am doing is like giving</span> <span m="213000">a language course and teaching you how to say hello and</span> <span m="217000">good-bye in French, German, Spanish,</span> <span m="220000">and Italian. It is not going very deeply</span> <span m="223000">into any of those languages, but you are going into the</span> <span m="227000">outside world, where people will speak these</span> <span m="230000">things. Here is an introduction to the</span> <span m="232000">language of decoupling in which for some people is the exclusive</span> <span m="237000">language in which they talk about systems.</span> <span m="242000">Now, I think the best way to, well, in a general way,</span> <span m="246000">what you try to do is as follows.</span> <span m="249000">You try to introduce new variables.</span> <span m="253000">You make a change of variables. I am going to do it two-by-two</span> <span m="258000">just to save a lot of writing out.</span> <span m="262000">And it's going to be a linear change of variables because we</span> <span m="267000">are interested in linear systems.</span> <span m="272000">The problem is to find u and v such that something wonderful</span> <span m="277000">happens, such that when you make the change of variables to</span> <span m="283000">express this system in terms of u and v it becomes decoupled.</span> <span m="289000">And that means the system turns into a system which looks like u</span> <span m="296000">prime equals k1 times u and v prime equals k2</span> <span m="301000">times v. Such a system is called</span> <span m="306000">decoupled. Why?</span> <span m="308000">Well, a normal system is called coupled.</span> <span m="311000">Let's write out what it would be.</span> <span m="314000">Well, let's not write that. You know what it looks like.</span> <span m="318000">This is decoupled because it is not really a system at all.</span> <span m="323000">It is just two first-order equations sitting side by side</span> <span m="328000">and having nothing whatever to do with each other.</span> <span m="334000">This is two problems from the first day of the term.</span> <span m="338000">It is not one problem from the next to last day of the term,</span> <span m="344000">in other words. To solve this all you say is u</span> <span m="348000">is equal to some constant times e to the k1 t and v</span> <span m="354000">equals another constant times e to the k2 t.</span> <span m="360000">Coupled means that the x and y occur in both equations on the</span> <span m="364000">right-hand side. And, therefore,</span> <span m="366000">you cannot solve separately for x and y, you must solve together</span> <span m="370000">for both of them. Here I can solve separately for</span> <span m="374000">u and v and, therefore, the system has been decoupled.</span> <span m="377000">Now, obviously, if you can do that it's an</span> <span m="380000">enormous advantage, not just to the ease of</span> <span m="383000">solution, because you can write down the solution immediately,</span> <span m="388000">but because something physical must be going on there.</span> <span m="393000">There must be some insight. There ought to be some physical</span> <span m="397000">reason for these new variables. Now, that is where I plan to</span> <span m="402000">start with. My plan for the lecture is</span> <span m="405000">first to work out, in some detail,</span> <span m="408000">a specific example where decoupling is done to show how</span> <span m="412000">that leads to the solution. And then we will go back and</span> <span m="417000">see how to do it in general -- -- because you will see,</span> <span m="422000">as I do the decoupling in this particular example,</span> <span m="425000">that that particular method, though it is suggested,</span> <span m="429000">will not work in general. I would need a more general</span> <span m="433000">method. But let's first go to the</span> <span m="435000">example. It is a slight modification of</span> <span m="437000">one you should have done in recitation.</span> <span m="440000">I don't think I worked one of these in the lecture,</span> <span m="443000">but to describe it I have to draw two views of it to make</span> <span m="447000">sure you know exactly what I am talking about.</span> <span m="452000">Sometimes it is called the two compartment ice cube tray</span> <span m="455000">problem, a very old-fashion type of ice cube tray.</span> <span m="458000">Not a modern one that is all plastic where there is no</span> <span m="462000">leaking from one compartment to another.</span> <span m="464000">The old kind of ice cube trays, there were compartments and</span> <span m="468000">these were metal separated and you leveled the liquid because</span> <span m="472000">it could leak through the bottom that didn't go right to the</span> <span m="476000">bottom. If you don't know what I am</span> <span m="478000">talking about it makes no difference.</span> <span m="482000">This is the side view. This is meant to be twice as</span> <span m="486000">long. But, to make it quite clear,</span> <span m="489000">I will draw the top view of this thing.</span> <span m="492000">You have to imagine this is a rectangle, all the sides are</span> <span m="497000">parallel and everything. This is one and this is two.</span> <span m="501000">All I am trying to say is that the cross-sectional area of</span> <span m="506000">these two chambers, this one has twice the</span> <span m="509000">cross-sectional area of this one.</span> <span m="514000">So I will write a two here and I will write a one there.</span> <span m="517000">Of course, it is this hole here through which everything leaks.</span> <span m="522000">I am going to let x be the height of this liquid,</span> <span m="525000">the water here, and y the height of the water</span> <span m="528000">in that chamber. Obviously, as time goes by,</span> <span m="531000">they both reach the same height because of somebody's law.</span> <span m="535000">Now, what is the system of differential equations that</span> <span m="539000">controls this? Well, the essential thing is</span> <span m="544000">the flow rate through here. That flow rate through the hole</span> <span m="551000">in units, let's say, in liters per second.</span> <span m="556000">Just so you understand, I am talking about the volume</span> <span m="562000">of liquid. I am not talking about the</span> <span m="567000">velocity. That is proportional to the</span> <span m="571000">area of the hole. So the cross-sectional area of</span> <span m="577000">the hole. And it is also times the</span> <span m="580000">velocity of the flow, but the velocity of the flow</span> <span m="584000">depends upon the pressure difference.</span> <span m="587000">And that pressure difference depends upon the difference in</span> <span m="592000">height. All those are various people's</span> <span m="595000">laws. So times the height difference.</span> <span m="600000">Of course, you have to get the sign right.</span> <span m="603000">I have just pointed out the height difference is</span> <span m="606000">proportional to the pressure at the hole.</span> <span m="610000">And it is that pressure at the hole that determines the</span> <span m="614000">velocity with which the fluid flows through.</span> <span m="617000">Where does this all produce our equations?</span> <span m="621000">Well, x prime is equal to, therefore, some constant,</span> <span m="625000">depending on the area of the hole and this constant of</span> <span m="629000">proportionality with the pressure and the units and</span> <span m="633000">everything else times the pressure difference I am talking</span> <span m="637000">about. Well, if fluid is going to flow</span> <span m="643000">in this direction that must mean the y height is higher than the</span> <span m="649000">x height. So, to make x prime positive,</span> <span m="652000">it should be y minus x here.</span> <span m="656000">Now, the y prime is different. Because, again,</span> <span m="661000">the rate of fluid flow is determined.</span> <span m="663000">This time, if y prime is positive, if this is rising,</span> <span m="668000">as it will be in this case, it's because the fluid is</span> <span m="672000">flowing in that direction. It is because x is higher than</span> <span m="676000">y. So this should be the same</span> <span m="678000">constant x minus y. But notice that right-hand side</span> <span m="683000">is the rate at which fluid is flowing into this tank.</span> <span m="687000">That is not the rate at which y is changing.</span> <span m="692000">It is the rate at which 2y is changing.</span> <span m="694000">Why isn't there a constant here?</span> <span m="696000">There is. It's one.</span> <span m="698000">That is the one, this one cross-section.</span> <span m="701000">The area here is one and the cross-sectional area here is</span> <span m="705000">two. And that is the reason for the</span> <span m="707000">one here and the two here, because we are interested in</span> <span m="711000">the rate at which fluid is being added to this,</span> <span m="714000">which is only related to the height, the rate at which the</span> <span m="718000">height is rising if you take into account the cross-sectional</span> <span m="723000">area. So there is the system.</span> <span m="727000">In order to use nothing but integers here,</span> <span m="731000">I am going to take c equals to two, so I don't have to put in</span> <span m="737000">halves. The final system is x prime</span> <span m="741000">equals minus 2x, you have to write them in the</span> <span m="745000">correct order, and y prime equals,</span> <span m="749000">the twos cancel because c is two, is x minus y.</span> <span m="755000">So there is our system. Now the problem is I want to</span> <span m="758000">solve it by decoupling it. I want, in other words,</span> <span m="762000">to find new variables, u and v, which are more natural</span> <span m="766000">to the problem than the x and y that are so natural to the</span> <span m="770000">problem that the new system will just consistently be two</span> <span m="774000">side-by-side equations instead of the single equation.</span> <span m="779000">The question is, what should u and v be?</span> <span m="781000">Now, the difference between what I am going to do now and</span> <span m="785000">what I am going to do later in the period is later in the</span> <span m="788000">period I will give you a systematic way of finding what u</span> <span m="792000">and v should be. Now we are going to psyche out</span> <span m="795000">what they should be in the way in which people who solve</span> <span m="798000">systems often do. I am going to use the fact that</span> <span m="801000">this is not just an abstract system of equations.</span> <span m="804000">It comes from some physical problem.</span> <span m="808000">And I ask, is there some system of variables,</span> <span m="811000">which somehow go more deeply into the structure of what's</span> <span m="816000">going on here than the naÄ«ve variables, which simply tell me</span> <span m="821000">how high the two tank levels are?</span> <span m="824000">That is the obvious thing I can see, but there are some</span> <span m="828000">variables that go more deeply. Now, one of them is sort of</span> <span m="833000">obvious and suggested both the form of the equation and by</span> <span m="838000">this. Simply, the difference in</span> <span m="841000">heights is, in some ways, a more natural variable because</span> <span m="845000">that is directly related to the pressure difference,</span> <span m="849000">which is directly related to the velocity of flow.</span> <span m="852000">They will differ by just constant.</span> <span m="854000">I am going to call that the second variable,</span> <span m="857000">or the difference in height let's call it.</span> <span m="860000">That's x minus y. That is a very natural variable</span> <span m="863000">for the problem. The question is,</span> <span m="865000">what should the other one be? Now you sort of stare at that</span> <span m="871000">for a while until it occurs to you that something is constant.</span> <span m="875000">What is constant in this problem?</span> <span m="878000">Well, the tank is sitting there, that is constant.</span> <span m="882000">But what thing, which might be a variable,</span> <span m="885000">clearly must be a constant? It will be the total amount of</span> <span m="889000">water in the two tanks. These things vary,</span> <span m="892000">but the total amount of water stays the same because it is a</span> <span m="897000">homogenous problem. No water is coming in from the</span> <span m="902000">outside, and none is leaving the tanks through a little hole.</span> <span m="908000">Okay. What is the expression for the</span> <span m="911000">total amount of water in the tanks?</span> <span m="914000">x plus 2y. Therefore, that is a natural</span> <span m="919000">variable also. It is independent of this one.</span> <span m="923000">It is not a simple multiply of it.</span> <span m="926000">It is a really different variable.</span> <span m="931000">This variable represents the total amount of liquid in the</span> <span m="936000">two tanks. This represents the pressure up</span> <span m="940000">to a constant factor. It is proportional to the</span> <span m="945000">pressure at the hole. Okay.</span> <span m="948000">Now what I am going to do is say this is my change of</span> <span m="953000">variable. Now let's plug in and see what</span> <span m="957000">happens to the system when I plug in these two variables.</span> <span m="964000">And how do I do that? Well, I want to substitute and</span> <span m="969000">get the new system. The new system,</span> <span m="973000">or rather the old system, but what makes it new is in</span> <span m="979000">terms of u and v. What will that be?</span> <span m="982000">Well, u prime is x prime plus 2y prime.</span> <span m="990000">But I know what x prime plus 2y prime is because I</span> <span m="995000">can calculate it for this. What will it be?</span> <span m="1000000">x prime plus 2y prime is negative 2x plus twice y prime,</span> <span m="1005000">so it's plus 2x, which is zero.</span> <span m="1008000">And how about these two? 2y minus twice this,</span> <span m="1012000">because I want this plus twice that, so it 2y minus 2y,</span> <span m="1017000">again, zero. The right-hand side becomes</span> <span m="1022000">zero after I calculate x prime plus 2y.</span> <span m="1026000">So that is zero. That would just,</span> <span m="1029000">of course, clear. Now, that makes sense,</span> <span m="1032000">of course. Since the total amount is</span> <span m="1035000">constant, that says that u prime is zero.</span> <span m="1039000">Okay. What is v prime?</span> <span m="1041000">v prime is x prime minus y prime.</span> <span m="1045000">What is that? Well, once again we have to</span> <span m="1051000">calculate. x prime minus y prime is minus</span> <span m="1056000">2x minus x, which is minus 3x, and 2y minus negative y,</span> <span m="1063000">which makes plus 3y. All right.</span> <span m="1066000">What is the system? The system is u prime equals</span> <span m="1072000">zero and v prime equals minus three times x minus</span> <span m="1080000">y. But x minus y is v.</span> <span m="1087000">In other words,</span> <span m="1089000">these new two variables decouple the system.</span> <span m="1094000">And we got them, as scientists often do,</span> <span m="1098000">by physical considerations. These variables go more deeply</span> <span m="1104000">into what is going on in that system of two tanks than simply</span> <span m="1111000">the two heights, which are too obvious as</span> <span m="1115000">variables. All right.</span> <span m="1118000">What is the solution? Well, the solution is,</span> <span m="1122000">u equals a constant and v is equal to?</span> <span m="1125000">Well, the solution to this equation is a different</span> <span m="1130000">arbitrary constant from that one.</span> <span m="1133000">These are side-by-side equations that have nothing</span> <span m="1137000">whatever to do with each other, remember?</span> <span m="1142000">Times e to the minus 3t.</span> <span m="1145000">Now, there are two options. Either one leaves the solution</span> <span m="1150000">in terms of those new variables, saying they are more natural to</span> <span m="1155000">the problem, but sometimes, of course, one wants the answer</span> <span m="1160000">in terms of the old one. But, if you do that,</span> <span m="1164000">then you have to solve that. In order to save a little time,</span> <span m="1169000">since this is purely linear algebra, I am going to write --</span> <span m="1176000">Instead of taking two minutes to actually do the calculation</span> <span m="1179000">in front of you, I will just write down what the</span> <span m="1182000">answer is --</span> <span m="1193000">-- in terms of u and x and y. In other words,</span> <span m="1196000">this is a perfectly good way to leave the answer if you are</span> <span m="1202000">allowed to do it. But if somebody says they want</span> <span m="1206000">the answer in terms of x and y, well, you have to give them</span> <span m="1210000">what they are paying for. In terms of x and y,</span> <span m="1213000">you have first to solve those equations backwards for x and y</span> <span m="1217000">in terms of u and v in which case you will get x equals</span> <span m="1221000">one-third of u plus 2v.</span> <span m="1224000">Use the inverse matrix or just do elimination,</span> <span m="1227000">whatever you usually like to do.</span> <span m="1231000">And the other one will be one-third of u minus v.</span> <span m="1241000">And then, if you substitute in,</span> <span m="1247000">you will see what you will get is one-third of c1.</span> <span m="1256000">Sorry. u is c1.</span> <span m="1275000">c1 plus 2 c2 e to the negative 3t.</span> <span m="1279000">And this is one-third of c1 minus c2 e to the minus 3t.</span> <span m="1284000">And so, the final solution is,</span> <span m="1288000">in terms of the way we usually write out the answer,</span> <span m="1293000">x will be what? Well, it will be one-third c1</span> <span m="1298000">times the eigenvector one, one plus one-third times c2</span> <span m="1303000">times the eigenvector two, negative one times e to the</span> <span m="1309000">minus 3t. That is the solution written</span> <span m="1314000">out in terms of x and y either as a vector in the usual way or</span> <span m="1320000">separately in terms of x and y. But, notice,</span> <span m="1325000">in order to do that you have to have these backwards equations.</span> <span m="1330000">In other words, I need the equations in that</span> <span m="1333000">form. I need the equations because</span> <span m="1336000">they tell me what the new variables are.</span> <span m="1339000">But I also have to have the equations the other way in order</span> <span m="1344000">to get the solution in terms of x and y, finally.</span> <span m="1347000">Okay. That was all an example.</span> <span m="1351000">For the rest of the period, I would like to show you the</span> <span m="1355000">general method of doing the same thing which does not depend upon</span> <span m="1360000">being clever about the choice of the new variables.</span> <span m="1363000">And then, at the very end of the period, I will apply the</span> <span m="1368000">general method to this problem to see whether we get the same</span> <span m="1372000">answer or not. What is the general method?</span> <span m="1375000">Our problem is the decouple. Now, the first thing is you</span> <span m="1380000">cannot always decouple. To decouple the eigenvalues</span> <span m="1385000">must all be real and non-defective.</span> <span m="1389000">In other words, if they are repeated they must</span> <span m="1393000">be complete. You must have enough</span> <span m="1396000">independent eigenvectors. So they must be real and</span> <span m="1401000">complete. If repeated,</span> <span m="1403000">they must be complete. They must not be defective.</span> <span m="1410000">As I told you at the time when we studied complete and</span> <span m="1414000">incomplete, the most common case in which this occurs is when the</span> <span m="1420000">matrix is symmetric. If the matrix is real and</span> <span m="1424000">symmetric then you can always decouple the system.</span> <span m="1429000">That is a very important theorem, particularly since many</span> <span m="1434000">of the equilibrium problems normally lead to symmetric</span> <span m="1439000">matrices and are solved by decoupling.</span> <span m="1444000">Okay. So what are we looking for?</span> <span m="1457000">We are assuming this and we need it.</span> <span m="1459000">In general, otherwise, you cannot decouple if you have</span> <span m="1463000">complex eigenvalues and you cannot decouple if you have</span> <span m="1467000">defective eigenvalues.</span> <span m="1474000">Well, what are we looking for? We are looking for new</span> <span m="1479000">variables. u, v equals a1,</span> <span m="1482000">b1, a2, b2 times the x, y.</span> <span m="1489000">And this matrix is called D, the decoupling matrix and is</span> <span m="1496000">what we are looking for. How do I choose those new</span> <span m="1501000">variables u and v when I don't have any physical considerations</span> <span m="1506000">to guide me as I did before? Now, the key is to look instead</span> <span m="1511000">at what you are going to need. Remember, we are changing</span> <span m="1515000">variables. And, as I told you from the</span> <span m="1518000">first days of the term, when you change variables look</span> <span m="1522000">at what you are going to need to substitute in to make the change</span> <span m="1527000">of variables. Don't just start writing</span> <span m="1532000">equations. What we are going to need to</span> <span m="1535000">plug into that system and change it to the (u,</span> <span m="1539000">v) coordinates is not u and v in terms of x and y.</span> <span m="1544000">What we need is x and y in terms of u and v to do the</span> <span m="1549000">substitution. What we need is the inverse of</span> <span m="1552000">this. So, in order to do the</span> <span m="1555000">substitution, what we need is (x,</span> <span m="1558000">y). Oops.</span> <span m="1560000">Let's call them prime. Let's call these a1,</span> <span m="1564000">b1, a2, b2 because these are going to be much more important</span> <span m="1569000">to the problem than the other ones.</span> <span m="1572000">Okay. I am going to,</span> <span m="1573000">I should call this matrix D inverse, that would be a</span> <span m="1578000">sensible thing to call it. Since this is the important</span> <span m="1582000">matrix, this is the one we are going to need to do the</span> <span m="1587000">substitution, I am going to give it another</span> <span m="1591000">letter instead. And the letter that comes after</span> <span m="1597000">D is E. Now, E is an excellent choice</span> <span m="1600000">because it is also the first letter of the word eigenvector.</span> <span m="1606000">And the point is the matrix E, which is going to work,</span> <span m="1611000">is the matrix whose columns are the two eigenvectors.</span> <span m="1628000">The columns are the two eigenvectors.</span> <span m="1631000">Now, even if you didn't know anything that would be</span> <span m="1636000">practically the only reasonable choice anybody could make.</span> <span m="1641000">What are we looking for? To make a linear change of</span> <span m="1646000">variables like this really means to pick new i and j vectors.</span> <span m="1653000">You know, from the first days of 18.02, what you want is a new</span> <span m="1657000">coordinate system in the plane. And the coordinate system in</span> <span m="1661000">the plane is determined as soon as you tell what the new i is</span> <span m="1666000">and what the new j is in the new system.</span> <span m="1668000">To establish a linear change of coordinates amounts to picking</span> <span m="1673000">two new vectors that are going to play the role of i and j</span> <span m="1677000">instead of the old i and the old j.</span> <span m="1681000">Okay, so pick two vectors which somehow are important to this</span> <span m="1687000">matrix. Well, there are only two,</span> <span m="1691000">the eigenvectors. What else could they possibly</span> <span m="1697000">be? Now, what is the relation?</span> <span m="1700000">I say with this, what happens is I say that</span> <span m="1705000">alpha one corresponds, and alpha two,</span> <span m="1709000">these are vectors in the xy-system.</span> <span m="1715000">Well, if I change the coordinates to u and v,</span> <span m="1718000">in the uv-system they will correspond to the vectors one,</span> <span m="1722000">zero. In other words,</span> <span m="1725000">the vector that we would normally call i in the u,</span> <span m="1728000">v system. And this one will correspond to</span> <span m="1732000">the vector zero, one.</span> <span m="1734000">Now, if you don't believe that I will calculate it for you.</span> <span m="1740000">The calculation is trivial. Look.</span> <span m="1744000">What have we got? (x, y) equals a1,</span> <span m="1749000">b1, a2, b2.</span> <span m="1753000">This is the column vector alpha one.</span> <span m="1758000">This is the column vector alpha two.</span> <span m="1762000">Now, here is u and v. Suppose I make u and v equal to</span> <span m="1770000">one, zero, what happens to x and y?</span> <span m="1775000">Your matrix multiply. One, zero.</span> <span m="1778000">So a1 plus zero, b1 plus zero.</span> <span m="1785000">It corresponds to the column vector (a1, b1).</span> <span m="1790000">And in the same way zero, one corresponds to</span> <span m="1797000">(a2, b2).</span> <span m="1805000">Just by matrix multiplication. And that shows that these</span> <span m="1812000">correspond. In the uv-system the two</span> <span m="1816000">eigenvectors are now called i and j.</span> <span m="1821000">Well, that looks very promising, but the program now</span> <span m="1827000">is to do the substitution to substitute into the system x</span> <span m="1834000">prime equals Ax and see if it is decoupled in the</span> <span m="1842000">uv-coordinates. Now, I don't dare let you do</span> <span m="1847000">this by yourself because you will run into trouble.</span> <span m="1851000">Nothing is going to happen. You will just get a mess and</span> <span m="1854000">will say I must be missing something.</span> <span m="1857000">And that is because you are missing something.</span> <span m="1861000">What you are missing, and this is a good occasion to</span> <span m="1865000">tell you, is that, in general, three-quarters of</span> <span m="1869000">the civilized world does not introduce eigenvalues and</span> <span m="1874000">eigenvectors the way you learn them in 18.03.</span> <span m="1878000">They use a different definition that is identical.</span> <span m="1882000">I mean it is equivalent. The concept is the same,</span> <span m="1887000">but it looks a little different.</span> <span m="1891000">Our definition is what? Well, what is an eigenvalue and</span> <span m="1895000">eigenvector? The basic thing is this</span> <span m="1897000">equation.</span> <span m="1906000">This is a two-by-two matrix, right?</span> <span m="1908000">This is a column vector with two entries.</span> <span m="1911000">The product has to be a column vector with two entries,</span> <span m="1915000">but both entries are supposed to be zero so I will write it</span> <span m="1919000">this way. This way first defines what an</span> <span m="1923000">eigenvalue is. It is something that makes the</span> <span m="1926000">determinant zero. And then it defines what an</span> <span m="1929000">eigenvector is. It is, then,</span> <span m="1931000">a solution to the system that you can get because the</span> <span m="1935000">determinant is zero. Now, that is not what most</span> <span m="1939000">people do. What most people do is the</span> <span m="1941000">following. They write this equation</span> <span m="1944000">differently by having something on both sides.</span> <span m="1949000">Using the distributive law, what goes on the left side is A</span> <span m="1953000">alpha one. What is that?</span> <span m="1955000">That is a column vector with two entries.</span> <span m="1958000">What goes on the right? Well, lambda one times the</span> <span m="1962000">identity times alpha one. Now, the identity matrix times</span> <span m="1967000">anything just reproduces what was there.</span> <span m="1970000">There is no difference between writing the identity times alpha</span> <span m="1975000">one and just alpha one all by itself.</span> <span m="1980000">So that is what I am going to do.</span> <span m="1982000">This is the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvector that</span> <span m="1987000">all the other people use. Most linear algebra books use</span> <span m="1992000">this definition, or most books use a different</span> <span m="1996000">approach and say, here is an eigenvalue and an</span> <span m="2000000">eigenvector. And it requires them to define</span> <span m="2003000">them in the opposite order. First what alpha one is and</span> <span m="2008000">then what lambda one is. See, I don't have any</span> <span m="2013000">determinant now. So what is the definition?</span> <span m="2016000">And they like it because it has a certain geometric flavor that</span> <span m="2020000">this one lacks entirely. This is good for solving</span> <span m="2023000">differential equations, which is why we are using it in</span> <span m="2027000">18.03, but this has a certain geometric content.</span> <span m="2030000">This way thinks of A as a linear transformation of the</span> <span m="2034000">plane, a shearing of the plane. You take the plane and do</span> <span m="2037000">something to it. Or, you squish it like that.</span> <span m="2042000">Or, you rotate it. That's okay,</span> <span m="2044000">too. And the matrix defines a linear</span> <span m="2047000">transformation to the plane, every vector goes to another</span> <span m="2051000">vector. The question it asks is,</span> <span m="2054000">is there a vector which is taken by this linear</span> <span m="2058000">transformation and just left alone or stretched,</span> <span m="2061000">is kept in the same direction but stretched?</span> <span m="2065000">Or, maybe its direction is reversed and it is stretched or</span> <span m="2069000">it shrunk. But, in general,</span> <span m="2073000">if there are real eigenvalues there will be such vectors that</span> <span m="2078000">are just left in the same direction but just stretched or</span> <span m="2083000">shrunk. And what is the lambda?</span> <span m="2086000">The lambda then is the amount by which they are stretched or</span> <span m="2091000">shrunk, the factor. This way, first we have to find</span> <span m="2095000">the vector, which is left essentially unchanged,</span> <span m="2099000">and then the number here that goes with it is the stretching</span> <span m="2104000">factor or the shrinking factor. But the end result is the pair</span> <span m="2111000">alpha one and lambda one, regardless of which order you</span> <span m="2115000">find them, satisfied the same equation.</span> <span m="2118000">Now, a consequence of this definition we are going to need</span> <span m="2122000">in the calculation that I am going to do in just a moment.</span> <span m="2126000">Let me calculate that out. What I want to do is calculate</span> <span m="2131000">the matrix A times E. I am going to need to calculate</span> <span m="2136000">that. Now, what is that?</span> <span m="2138000">Remember, E is the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors.</span> <span m="2143000">That is the matrix alpha one, alpha two.</span> <span m="2147000">Now, what is this? Well, in both Friday's lecture</span> <span m="2151000">and Monday's lecture, I used the fact that if you do</span> <span m="2155000">a multiplication like that it is the same thing as doing the</span> <span m="2161000">multiplication A alpha one and putting it in the first column.</span> <span m="2168000">And then A alpha two is the column vector that goes in the</span> <span m="2173000">second column. But what is this?</span> <span m="2176000">This is lambda one alpha one. And this is lambda two alpha</span> <span m="2182000">two by this other definition of eigenvalue and eigenvector.</span> <span m="2188000">And what is this? Can I write this in terms of</span> <span m="2194000">matrices? Yes indeed I can.</span> <span m="2196000">This is the matrix alpha one, alpha two times this matrix</span> <span m="2202000">lambda one, lambda two, zero, zero.</span> <span m="2206000">Check it out. Lambda one plus zero,</span> <span m="2210000">lambda one times this thing plus zero, the first entry is</span> <span m="2216000">exactly that. And the same way the second</span> <span m="2221000">column doing the same calculation is exactly this.</span> <span m="2226000">What is that? That is e times this matrix</span> <span m="2230000">lambda one, zero, zero, lambda two.</span> <span m="2234000">Okay. We are almost finished now.</span> <span m="2237000">Now we can carry out our work. We are going to do the</span> <span m="2242000">substitution. I start with a system.</span> <span m="2246000">Remember where we are. I am starting with this system.</span> <span m="2253000">I am going to make the substitution x equal to this</span> <span m="2259000">matrix E, whose columns are the eigenvectors.</span> <span m="2265000">I am in introducing, in other words,</span> <span m="2269000">new variables u and v according to that thing.</span> <span m="2275000">u is the column vector, u and v.</span> <span m="2280000">And x, as usual,</span> <span m="2283000">is the column vector x and y. So I am going to plug it in.</span> <span m="2288000">Okay. Let's plug it in.</span> <span m="2290000">What do I get? I take the derivative.</span> <span m="2293000">E is a constant matrix so that makes E times u prime,</span> <span m="2297000">is equal to A times, x is E times u again.</span> <span m="2301000">Now, at this point,</span> <span m="2304000">you would be stuck, except I calculated for you A</span> <span m="2308000">times E is E times that funny diagonal matrix with the</span> <span m="2312000">lambdas. So this is E times that funny</span> <span m="2318000">matrix of the lambdas, the eigenvalues,</span> <span m="2321000">and still the u at the end of it.</span> <span m="2325000">So where are we? E times u prime equals E times</span> <span m="2330000">this thing. Well, multiply both sides by E</span> <span m="2334000">inverse and you can cancel them out.</span> <span m="2339000">And so the end result is that after you have made the</span> <span m="2344000">substitution in terms of the new variables u, what you get is u</span> <span m="2350000">prime equals lambda one, lambda two, zero,</span> <span m="2354000">zero times u. Let's write that out in terms</span> <span m="2358000">of a system. This is u prime is equal to,</span> <span m="2362000">well, this is u, v here.</span> <span m="2364000">It is lambda one times u plus zero times v.</span> <span m="2370000">And the other one is v prime equals zero times u plus lambda</span> <span m="2380000">two times v. We are decoupled.</span> <span m="2385000">In just one sentence you would say --</span> <span m="2392000">In other words, if you were reading a book that</span> <span m="2395000">sort of assumed you knew what was going on,</span> <span m="2399000">all it would say is as usual. That is to make you feel bad.</span> <span m="2404000">Or, as is well-known to make you feel even worse.</span> <span m="2408000">Or, the system is decoupled by choosing as the new basis for</span> <span m="2413000">the system the eigenvectors of the matrix and in terms of the</span> <span m="2418000">resulting new coordinates, the decoupled system will be</span> <span m="2423000">the following where the constants are the eigenvalues.</span> <span m="2429000">And so the solution will be u equals c1 times e to the lambda1</span> <span m="2433000">t and v is equal to c2 times e to the</span> <span m="2438000">lambda2 t.</span> <span m="2440000">Of course, if you want it back in terms now of x and y,</span> <span m="2444000">you will have to go back to here, to these equations and</span> <span m="2448000">then plug in for u and v what they are.</span> <span m="2451000">And then you will get the answer in terms of x and y.</span> <span m="2455000">Okay. We have just enough time to</span> <span m="2459000">actually carry out this little program.</span> <span m="2464000">It takes a lot longer to derive than it does actually to do,</span> <span m="2470000">so let's do it for this system that we were talking about</span> <span m="2476000">before. Decouple the system,</span> <span m="2479000">x, y prime equals the matrixes negative two,</span> <span m="2484000">two, one, negative one.</span> <span m="2496000">Okay. What do I do?</span> <span m="2497000">Well, I first have to calculate the eigenvalues in the</span> <span m="2502000">eigenvectors, so the Ev's and Ev's.</span> <span m="2505000">The characteristic equation is lambda squared.</span> <span m="2509000">The trace is negative three, but you have to change the</span> <span m="2514000">sign. The determinant is two minus</span> <span m="2517000">two, so that is zero. There is no constant term here.</span> <span m="2522000">It is zero. That is the characteristic</span> <span m="2525000">equation. The roots are obviously lambda</span> <span m="2528000">equals zero, lambda equals negative three.</span> <span m="2532000">And what are the eigenvectors that go with that?</span> <span m="2535000">With lambda equals zero goes the eigenvector,</span> <span m="2539000">minus two. Well, I subtract zero here,</span> <span m="2542000">so the equation I have to solve is minus 2 a1 plus --</span> <span m="2548000">I am not going to write 2 a2, which is what you have been</span> <span m="2552000">writing up until now. The reason is because I ran</span> <span m="2556000">into trouble with the notation and I had to use,</span> <span m="2560000">as the eigenvector, not a1, a2 but a1,</span> <span m="2563000">b1. So it should be a b1 here,</span> <span m="2566000">not the a2 that you are used to.</span> <span m="2568000">The solution, therefore, is alpha one equals</span> <span m="2572000">one, one. And for lambda equals negative</span> <span m="2575000">three, the corresponding eigenvector this time will be --</span> <span m="2582000">Now I have to subtract negative three from here,</span> <span m="2586000">so negative two minus negative three makes one.</span> <span m="2590000">That is a1 plus 2 b1 equals zero,</span> <span m="2595000">a logical choice for the eigenvector here.</span> <span m="2599000">The second eigenvector would be make b1 equal to one,</span> <span m="2604000">let's say, and then a1 will be negative two.</span> <span m="2608000">Okay. Now what do we have to do?</span> <span m="2612000">Now, what we want is the matrix E.</span> <span m="2615000">The matrix E is the matrix of eigenvectors,</span> <span m="2618000">so it is the matrix one, one, negative two,</span> <span m="2622000">one.</span> <span m="2624000">The next thing we want is what the new variables u and v are.</span> <span m="2630000">For that, we will need E inverse.</span> <span m="2632000">How do you calculate the inverse of a two-by-two matrix?</span> <span m="2639000">You switch the two diagonal elements, there I have switched</span> <span m="2644000">them, and you leave the other two where they are but change</span> <span m="2649000">their sign. So it is two up here and</span> <span m="2653000">negative one there. Maybe I should make this one</span> <span m="2657000">purple and then that one purple to indicate that I have switched</span> <span m="2663000">them. I am not done yet.</span> <span m="2665000">I have to divide by the determinant.</span> <span m="2670000">What is the determinant? It is one minus negative two,</span> <span m="2676000">which is three, so I have to divide by three.</span> <span m="2682000">I multiply everything here by one-third.</span> <span m="2687000">Okay. And what is the decoupled</span> <span m="2691000">system? The new variables are u equals</span> <span m="2696000">one-third.</span> <span m="2708000">In other words, the new variables are given by</span> <span m="2711000">D. It is u, v equals one,</span> <span m="2713000">two, negative one, one times one-third times x,y.</span> <span m="2719000">That is the expression for u,</span> <span m="2721000">v in terms of x and y. It's this matrix D,</span> <span m="2725000">the decoupling matrix which is the one that is used.</span> <span m="2730000">And that gives this system u equals one-third of x plus 2y</span> <span m="2737000">on top. And what is the v entry?</span> <span m="2744000">v is one-third of minus x plus y.</span> <span m="2751000">Now, are those the same variables that I used before?</span> <span m="2768000">Yes. This is my new and better you,</span> <span m="2770000">the one I got by just blindly following the method instead of</span> <span m="2774000">looking for physical things with physical meaning.</span> <span m="2777000">It differs from the old one just by a constant factor.</span> <span m="2781000">Now, that doesn't have any effect on the resulting equation</span> <span m="2785000">because if the old one is u prime equals zero the new one is</span> <span m="2789000">one-third u prime equals zero. It is still the same equation,</span> <span m="2794000">in other words. And how about this one?</span> <span m="2796000">This one differs from the other one by the factor minus</span> <span m="2800000">one-third. If I multiply that v through by</span> <span m="2803000">minus one-third, I get this v.</span> <span m="2805000">And, therefore, that too does not affect the</span> <span m="2807000">second equation. I simply multiply both sides by</span> <span m="2811000">minus one-third. The new v still satisfies the</span> <span m="2814000">equation minus three times v.</span> </p>
