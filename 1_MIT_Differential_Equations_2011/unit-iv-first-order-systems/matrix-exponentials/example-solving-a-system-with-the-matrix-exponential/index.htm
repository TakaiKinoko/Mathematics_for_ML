<p><span m="7000">We are going to need a few facts about fundamental</span> <span m="9000">matrices, and I am worried that over the weekend this spring</span> <span m="13000">activities weekend you might have forgotten them.</span> <span m="16000">So I will just spend two or three minutes reviewing the most</span> <span m="20000">essential things that we are going to need later in the</span> <span m="23000">period. What we are talking about is,</span> <span m="25000">I will try to color code things so you will know what they are.</span> <span m="30000">First of all, the basic problem is to solve a</span> <span m="32000">system of equations. And I am going to make that a</span> <span m="36000">two-by-two system, although practically everything</span> <span m="39000">I say today will also work for end-by-end systems.</span> <span m="42000">Your book tries to do it end-by-end, as usual,</span> <span m="45000">but I think it is easier to learn two-by-two first and</span> <span m="48000">generalize rather than to wade through the complications of</span> <span m="52000">end-by-end systems. So the problem is to solve it.</span> <span m="57000">And the method I used last time was to describe something called</span> <span m="62000">a fundamental matrix.</span> <span m="68000">A fundamental matrix for the system or for A,</span> <span m="72000">whichever you want, remember what that was.</span> <span m="77000">That was a two-by-two matrix of functions of t and whose columns</span> <span m="84000">were two independent solutions, x1, x2.</span> <span m="89000">These were two independent solutions.</span> <span m="92000">In other words, neither was a constant multiple</span> <span m="97000">of the other. Now, I spent a fair amount of</span> <span m="101000">time showing you the two essential properties that a</span> <span m="106000">fundamental matrix had. We are going to need those</span> <span m="111000">today, so let me remind you the basic properties of X and the</span> <span m="117000">properties by which you could recognize one if you were given</span> <span m="123000">one. First of all,</span> <span m="126000">the easy one, its determinant shall not be</span> <span m="129000">zero, is not zero for any t, for any value of the variable.</span> <span m="134000">That simply expresses the fact that its two columns are</span> <span m="138000">independent, linearly independent, not a multiple of</span> <span m="142000">each other. The other one was more bizarre,</span> <span m="146000">so I tried to call a little more attention to it.</span> <span m="151000">It was that the matrix satisfies a differential</span> <span m="154000">equation of its own, which looks almost the same,</span> <span m="158000">except it's a matrix differential equation.</span> <span m="161000">It is not our column vectors which are solutions but matrices</span> <span m="165000">as a whole which are solutions. In other words,</span> <span m="169000">if you take that matrix and differentiate every entry,</span> <span m="173000">what you get is the same as A multiplied by that matrix you</span> <span m="177000">started with. This, remember,</span> <span m="181000">expressed the fact, it was just really formal when</span> <span m="186000">you analyzed what it was, but it expressed the fact that</span> <span m="191000">it says that the columns solved the system.</span> <span m="195000">The first thing says the columns are independent and the</span> <span m="200000">second says each column separately is a solution to the</span> <span m="205000">system. That is as far,</span> <span m="207000">more or less. Then I went in another</span> <span m="211000">direction and we talked about variation of parameters.</span> <span m="214000">I am not going to come back to variation of parameters today.</span> <span m="217000">We are going in a different tack.</span> <span m="219000">And the tack we are going on is I want to first talk a little</span> <span m="223000">more about the fundamental matrix and then,</span> <span m="225000">as I said, we will talk about an entirely different method of</span> <span m="229000">solving the system, one which makes no mention of</span> <span m="232000">eigenvalues or eigenvectors, if you can believe that.</span> <span m="236000">But, first, the one confusing thing about the fundamental</span> <span m="240000">matrix is that it is not unique. I have carefully tried to avoid</span> <span m="245000">talking about the fundamental matrix because there is no "the"</span> <span m="249000">fundamental matrix, there is only "a" fundamental</span> <span m="253000">matrix. Why is that?</span> <span m="254000">Well, because these two columns can be any two independent</span> <span m="259000">solutions. And there are an infinity of</span> <span m="262000">ways of picking independent solutions.</span> <span m="264000">That means there is an infinity of possible fundamental</span> <span m="268000">matrices. Well, that is disgusting,</span> <span m="273000">but can we repair it a little bit?</span> <span m="276000">I mean maybe they are all derivable from each other in</span> <span m="280000">some simple way. And that is,</span> <span m="283000">of course, what is true. Now, as a prelude to doing</span> <span m="287000">that, I would like to show you what I wanted to show you on</span> <span m="292000">Friday but, again, I ran out of time,</span> <span m="295000">how to write the general solution --</span> <span m="305000">-- to the system. The system I am talking about</span> <span m="308000">is that pink system. Well, of course,</span> <span m="310000">the standard naÄve way of doing it is it's x equals,</span> <span m="313000">the general solution is an arbitrary constant times that</span> <span m="317000">first solution you found, plus c2, times another</span> <span m="320000">arbitrary constant, times the second solution you</span> <span m="324000">found. Okay. Now, how would you abbreviate that using the fundamental</span> <span m="328000">matrix? Well, I did something very</span> <span m="332000">similar to this on Friday, except these were called Vs.</span> <span m="338000">It was part of the variation parameters method,</span> <span m="342000">but I promised not to use those words today so I just said</span> <span m="348000">nothing. Okay.</span> <span m="349000">What is the answer? It is x equals,</span> <span m="353000">how do I write this using the fundamental matrix,</span> <span m="358000">x1, x2? Simple.</span> <span m="359000">It is capital X times the column vector whose entries are</span> <span m="365000">c1 and c2. In other words,</span> <span m="369000">it is x1, x2 times the column vector c1, c2,</span> <span m="373000">isn't it? Yeah.</span> <span m="375000">Because if you multiply this think top row,</span> <span m="379000">top row, top row c1, plus top row times c2,</span> <span m="383000">that exactly gives you the top row here.</span> <span m="387000">And the same way the bottom row here, times this vector,</span> <span m="393000">gives you the bottom row of that.</span> <span m="398000">It is just another way of writing that,</span> <span m="400000">but it looks very efficient. Sometimes efficiency isn't a</span> <span m="404000">good thing, you have to watch out for it, but here it is good.</span> <span m="409000">So, this is the general solution written out using a</span> <span m="413000">fundamental matrix. And you cannot use less symbols</span> <span m="416000">than that. There is just no way.</span> <span m="420000">But that gives us our answer to, what do all fundamental</span> <span m="425000">matrices look like?</span> <span m="438000">Well, they are two columns are solutions.</span> <span m="442000">The answer is they look like -- Now, the first column is an</span> <span m="448000">arbitrary solution. How do I write an arbitrary</span> <span m="451000">solution? There is the general solution.</span> <span m="455000">I make it a particular one by giving a particular value to</span> <span m="459000">that column vector of arbitrary constants like two,</span> <span m="463000">three or minus one, pi or something like that.</span> <span m="467000">The first guy is a solution, and I have just shown you I can</span> <span m="472000">write such a solution like X, c1 with a column vector,</span> <span m="476000">a particular column vector of numbers.</span> <span m="481000">This is a solution because the green thing says it is.</span> <span m="484000">And side by side, we will write another one.</span> <span m="488000">And now all I have to do is, of course, there is supposed to</span> <span m="492000">be a dependent. We will worry about that in</span> <span m="495000">just a moment. All I have to do is make this</span> <span m="498000">look better. Now, I told you last time,</span> <span m="501000">by the laws of matrix multiplication,</span> <span m="504000">if the first column is X c1 and the second column is X c2,</span> <span m="508000">using matrix multiplication that is the same as writing it</span> <span m="512000">this way. This square matrix times the</span> <span m="517000">matrix whose entries are the first column vector and the</span> <span m="522000">second column vector. Now, I am going to call this C.</span> <span m="527000">It is a square matrix of constants.</span> <span m="530000">It is a two-by-two matrix of constants.</span> <span m="534000">And so, the final way of writing it is just what</span> <span m="539000">corresponds to that, X times C.</span> <span m="543000">And so X is a given fundamental matrix, this one,</span> <span m="547000">that one, so the most general fundamental matrix is then the</span> <span m="553000">one you started with, and multiply it by an arbitrary</span> <span m="559000">square matrix of constants, except you want to be sure that</span> <span m="565000">the determinant is not zero. Well, the determinant of this</span> <span m="571000">guy won't be zero, so all you have to do is make</span> <span m="574000">sure that the determinant of C isn't zero either.</span> <span m="578000">In other words, the fundamental matrix is not</span> <span m="581000">unique, but once you found one all the other ones are found by</span> <span m="586000">multiplying it on the right by an arbitrary square matrix of</span> <span m="591000">constants, which is nonsingular, it has determinant nonzero in</span> <span m="595000">other words. Well, that was all Friday.</span> <span m="600000">That's Friday leaking over into Monday.</span> <span m="603000">And now we begin the true Monday.</span> <span m="615000">Here is the problem. Once again we have our</span> <span m="619000">two-by-two system, or end-by-end if you want to be</span> <span m="624000">super general. There is a system.</span> <span m="628000">What do we have so far by way of solving it?</span> <span m="634000">Well, if your kid brother or sister when you go home said,</span> <span m="638000">a precocious kid, okay, tell me how to solve this</span> <span m="641000">thing, I think the only thing you will be able to say is well,</span> <span m="645000">you do this, you take the matrix and then</span> <span m="648000">you calculate something called eigenvalues and eigenvectors.</span> <span m="652000">Do you know what those are? I didn't think you did,</span> <span m="656000">blah, blah, blah, show how smart I am.</span> <span m="660000">And you then explain what the eigenvalues and eigenvectors</span> <span m="663000">are. And then you show how out of</span> <span m="665000">those make up special solutions. And then you take a combination</span> <span m="669000">of that. In other words,</span> <span m="671000">it is algorithm. It is something you do,</span> <span m="673000">a process, a method. And when it is all done,</span> <span m="676000">you have the general solution. Now, that is fine for</span> <span m="679000">calculating particular problems with a definite model with</span> <span m="683000">definite numbers in it where you want a definite answer.</span> <span m="688000">And, of course, a lot of your work in</span> <span m="690000">engineering and science classes is that kind of work.</span> <span m="694000">But the further you get on, well, when you start reading</span> <span m="699000">books, for example, or god forbid start reading</span> <span m="702000">papers in which people are telling you, you know,</span> <span m="706000">they are doing engineering or they are doing science,</span> <span m="710000">they don't want a method, what they want is a formula.</span> <span m="714000">In other words, the problem is to fill in the</span> <span m="717000">blank in the following. You are writing a paper,</span> <span m="722000">and you just set up some elaborate model and A is a</span> <span m="726000">matrix derived from that model in some way, represents bacteria</span> <span m="731000">doing something or bank accounts doing something,</span> <span m="735000">I don't know. And you say,</span> <span m="737000">as is well-known, the solution is,</span> <span m="740000">of course, you only have letters here,</span> <span m="743000">no numbers. This is a general paper.</span> <span m="745000">The solution is given by the formula.</span> <span m="755000">The only trouble is, we don't have a formula.</span> <span m="758000">All we have is a method. Now, people don't like that.</span> <span m="762000">What I am going to produce for you this period is a formula,</span> <span m="767000">and that formula does not require the calculation of any</span> <span m="771000">eigenvalues, eigenvectors, doesn't require any of that.</span> <span m="775000">It is, therefore, a very popular way to fill in</span> <span m="779000">to finish that sentence. Now the question is where is</span> <span m="784000">that formula going to come from? Well, we are,</span> <span m="788000">for the moment, clueless.</span> <span m="790000">If you are clueless the place to look always is do I know</span> <span m="794000">anything about this sort of thing?</span> <span m="797000">I mean is there some special case of this problem I can solve</span> <span m="802000">or that I have solved in the past?</span> <span m="805000">And the answer to that is yes. You haven't solved it for a</span> <span m="811000">two-by-two matrix but you have solved it for a one-by-one</span> <span m="815000">matrix. A one-by-one matrix also goes</span> <span m="818000">by the name of a constant. It is just a thing.</span> <span m="821000">It's a number. Just putting brackets around it</span> <span m="825000">doesn't conceal the fact that it is just a number.</span> <span m="828000">Let's look at what the solution is for a one-by-one matrix,</span> <span m="833000">a one-by-one case. If we are looking for a general</span> <span m="837000">solution for the end-by-end case, it must work for the</span> <span m="841000">one-by-one case also. That is a good reason for us</span> <span m="847000">starting. That looks like x,</span> <span m="850000">doesn't it? A one-by-one case.</span> <span m="860000">Well, in that case, I am trying to solve the</span> <span m="863000">system. The system consists of a single</span> <span m="866000">equation. That is the way the system</span> <span m="869000">looks. How do you solve that?</span> <span m="873000">Well, you were born knowing how to solve that.</span> <span m="877000">Anyway, you certainly didn't learn it in this course.</span> <span m="882000">You separate variables, blah, blah, blah,</span> <span m="886000">and the solution is x equals, the basic solution is e to the</span> <span m="892000">at, and you multiply that by an</span> <span m="896000">arbitrary constant. Now, that is a formula for the</span> <span m="902000">solution. And it uses the parameter in</span> <span m="905000">the equation. I didn't have to know a special</span> <span m="909000">number. I didn't have to put a</span> <span m="911000">particular number here to use that.</span> <span m="914000">Well, the answer is that the same idea, whatever the answer I</span> <span m="920000">give here has got to work in this case, too.</span> <span m="923000">But let's take a quick look as to why this works.</span> <span m="929000">Of course, you separate variables and use calculus.</span> <span m="932000">I am going to give you a slightly different argument that</span> <span m="936000">has the advantage of generalizing to the end-by-end</span> <span m="939000">case. And the argument goes as</span> <span m="941000">follows for that. It uses the definition of the</span> <span m="944000">exponential function not as the inverse to the logarithm,</span> <span m="948000">which is where the fancy calculus books get it from,</span> <span m="952000">nor as the naÄve high school method, e squared means</span> <span m="956000">you multiply e by itself and e cubed means you do it three</span> <span m="960000">times and so on. And e to the one-half means you</span> <span m="965000">do it a half a time or something.</span> <span m="967000">So, the naÄve definition of the exponential function.</span> <span m="971000">Instead, I will use the definition of the exponential</span> <span m="974000">function that comes from an infinite series.</span> <span m="977000">Leaving out the arbitrary constant that we don't have to</span> <span m="981000">bother with. e to the a t is the series one</span> <span m="984000">plus at plus a squared t squared over two factorial.</span> <span m="992000">I will put out one more term and let's call it quits there.</span> <span m="998000">If I take this then argument goes let's just differentiate</span> <span m="1004000">it. In other words,</span> <span m="1006000">what is the derivative of e to the at with respect to t?</span> <span m="1012000">Well, just differentiating term</span> <span m="1017000">by term it is zero plus the first term is a,</span> <span m="1021000">the next term is a squared times t.</span> <span m="1028000">This differentiates to t squared over two factorial.</span> <span m="1033000">And the answer is that this is</span> <span m="1037000">equal to a times, if you factor out the a,</span> <span m="1041000">what is left is one plus a t plus a squared t squared over</span> <span m="1046000">two factorial</span> <span m="1052000">In other words, it is simply e to the at.</span> <span m="1054000">In other words,</span> <span m="1056000">by differentiating the series, using the series definition of</span> <span m="1060000">the exponential and by differentiating it term by term,</span> <span m="1064000">I can immediately see that is satisfies this differential</span> <span m="1068000">equation. What about the arbitrary</span> <span m="1070000">constant? Well, if you would like,</span> <span m="1072000">you can include it here, but it is easier to observe</span> <span m="1076000">that by linearity if e to the a t solves the equation so does</span> <span m="1080000">the constant times it because the equation is linear.</span> <span m="1085000">Now, that is the idea that I am going to use to solve the system</span> <span m="1092000">in general. What are we doing to say?</span> <span m="1096000">Well, what could we say? The solution to,</span> <span m="1101000">well, let's get two solutions at once by writing a fundamental</span> <span m="1108000">matrix. "A" fundamental matrix,</span> <span m="1113000">I don't claim it is "the" one, for the system x prime equals A</span> <span m="1121000">x. That is what we are trying to</span> <span m="1126000">solve. And we are going to get two</span> <span m="1131000">solutions by getting a fundamental matrix for it.</span> <span m="1137000">The answer is e to the a t.</span> <span m="1144000">Isn't that what it should be? I had a little a.</span> <span m="1147000">Now we have a matrix. Okay, just put the matrix up</span> <span m="1151000">there. Now, what on earth?</span> <span m="1153000">The first person who must have thought of this,</span> <span m="1156000">it happened about 100 years ago, what meaning should be</span> <span m="1160000">given to e to a matrix power? Well, clearly the two naâ¢ve</span> <span m="1165000">definitions won't work. The only possible meaning you</span> <span m="1170000">could try for is using the infinite series,</span> <span m="1173000">but that does work. So this is a definition I am</span> <span m="1177000">giving you, the exponential matrix.</span> <span m="1180000">Now, notice the A is a two-by-two matrix multiplying it</span> <span m="1184000">by t. What I have up here is that</span> <span m="1186000">it's basically a two-by-two matrix.</span> <span m="1189000">Its entries involve t, but it's a two-by-two matrix.</span> <span m="1193000">Okay. We are trying to get the analog</span> <span m="1196000">of that formula over there. Well, leave the first term out</span> <span m="1202000">just for a moment. The next term is going to</span> <span m="1205000">surely be A times t. This is a two-by-two matrix,</span> <span m="1209000">right? What should the next term be?</span> <span m="1212000">Well, A squared times t squared over two factorial.</span> <span m="1216000">What kind of a guy is that? Well, if A is a two-by-two</span> <span m="1220000">matrix so is A squared. How about this?</span> <span m="1223000">This is just a scalar which multiplies every entry of A</span> <span m="1228000">squared. And, therefore,</span> <span m="1230000">this is still a two-by-two matrix.</span> <span m="1233000">That is a two-by-two matrix. This is a two-by-two matrix.</span> <span m="1236000">No matter how many times you multiply A by itself it stays a</span> <span m="1240000">two-by-two matrix. It gets more and more</span> <span m="1243000">complicated looking but it is always a two-by-two matrix.</span> <span m="1246000">And now I am multiplying every entry of that by the scalar t</span> <span m="1250000">cubed over three factorial.</span> <span m="1253000">I am continuing on in that way. What I get, therefore,</span> <span m="1256000">is a sum of two-by-two matrices.</span> <span m="1260000">Well, you can add two-by-two matrices to each other.</span> <span m="1263000">We've never made an infinite series of them,</span> <span m="1266000">we haven't done it, but others have.</span> <span m="1269000">And this is what they wrote. The only question is,</span> <span m="1272000">what should we put in the beginning?</span> <span m="1275000">Over there I have the number one.</span> <span m="1277000">But I, of course, cannot add the number one to a</span> <span m="1280000">two-by-two matrices. What goes here must be a</span> <span m="1283000">two-by-two matrix, which is the closest thing to</span> <span m="1287000">one I can think of. What should it be?</span> <span m="1291000">The I. Two-by-two I.</span> <span m="1292000">Two-by-two identity matrix looks like the natural candidate</span> <span m="1297000">for what to put there. And, in fact,</span> <span m="1300000">it is the right thing to put there.</span> <span m="1302000">Okay. Now I have a conjecture,</span> <span m="1305000">you know, purely formally, changing only with a keystroke</span> <span m="1309000">of the computer, all the little a's have been</span> <span m="1313000">changed to capital A's. And now all I have to do is</span> <span m="1317000">wonder if this is going to work. Well, what is the basic thing I</span> <span m="1323000">have to check to see that it is the fundamental matrix?</span> <span m="1327000">The question is, I wrote it down all right,</span> <span m="1331000">but is this a fundamental matrix for the system?</span> <span m="1334000">Well, I have a way of recognizing a fundamental matrix</span> <span m="1339000">when I see one. The critical thing is that it</span> <span m="1342000">should satisfy this matrix differential equation.</span> <span m="1346000">That is what I should verify. Does this guy that I have</span> <span m="1352000">written down satisfy this equation?</span> <span m="1355000">And the answer is, number two is,</span> <span m="1357000">it satisfies x prime equals Ax.</span> <span m="1361000">In other words, plugging in x equals this e to</span> <span m="1365000">the at, whose definition I just gave</span> <span m="1369000">you. If I substitute that in,</span> <span m="1371000">does it satisfy that matrix differential equation?</span> <span m="1376000">The answer is yes. I am not going to calculate it</span> <span m="1380000">out because the calculation is actually identical to what I did</span> <span m="1384000">there. The only difference is when I</span> <span m="1386000">differentiated it term by term, how do you differentiate</span> <span m="1390000">something like this? Well, you differentiate every</span> <span m="1393000">term in it. But, if you work it out,</span> <span m="1395000">this is a constant matrix, every term of which is</span> <span m="1398000">multiplied by t squared over two factorial.</span> <span m="1401000">Well, if you differentiate every entry of that constant,</span> <span m="1405000">of that matrix, what you are going to get is A</span> <span m="1407000">squared times just the derivative of that part,</span> <span m="1410000">which is simply t. In other words,</span> <span m="1414000">the formal calculation looks absolutely identical to that.</span> <span m="1420000">So the answer to this is yes, by the same calculation as</span> <span m="1425000">before, as for the one-by-one case.</span> <span m="1428000">And now the only other thing to check is that the determinant is</span> <span m="1435000">not zero. In fact, the determinant is not</span> <span m="1439000">zero at one point. That is all you have to check.</span> <span m="1444000">What is x of zero? What is the value of the</span> <span m="1448000">determinant of x is e to the At?</span> <span m="1451000">What is the value of this thing at zero?</span> <span m="1454000">Here is my function. If I plug in t equals zero,</span> <span m="1458000">what is it equal to? I.</span> <span m="1460000">What is the determinant of I? One.</span> <span m="1462000">It is certainly not zero.</span> <span m="1478000">By writing down this infinite series, I have my two solutions.</span> <span m="1481000">Its columns give me two solutions to the original</span> <span m="1484000">system. There were no eigenvalues,</span> <span m="1487000">no eigenvectors. I have a formula for the</span> <span m="1489000">answer. What is the formula?</span> <span m="1491000">It is e to the At. And, of course,</span> <span m="1494000">anybody reading the paper is supposed to know what e to the</span> <span m="1497000">At is. It means that.</span> <span m="1500000">This is just marvelous. There must be a fly in the</span> <span m="1503000">ointment somewhere. Only a teeny little fly.</span> <span m="1507000">There is a teeny little fly because it is almost impossible</span> <span m="1511000">to calculate that series for all reasonable times.</span> <span m="1515000">However, once in a while it is. Let me give you an example</span> <span m="1520000">where it is possible to calculate the series and were</span> <span m="1524000">you get a nice answer. Let's work out an example.</span> <span m="1536000">By the way, you know, nowadays, we are not back 50</span> <span m="1540000">years, the exponential matrix has the same status on,</span> <span m="1545000">say, a Matlab or Maple or Mathematica, as the ordinary</span> <span m="1551000">exponential function does. It is just a command you type</span> <span m="1556000">in. You type in your matrix.</span> <span m="1560000">And you now say EXP of that matrix and out comes the answer</span> <span m="1564000">to as many decimal places as you want.</span> <span m="1566000">It will be square matrix with entries carefully written out.</span> <span m="1570000">So, in that sense, the fact that we cannot</span> <span m="1573000">calculate it shouldn't bother us.</span> <span m="1575000">There are machines to do the calculations.</span> <span m="1578000">What we are interested in is it as a theoretical tool.</span> <span m="1582000">But, in order to get any feeling for this at all,</span> <span m="1585000">we certainly have to do a few calculations.</span> <span m="1590000">Let's do an easy one. Let's consider the system x</span> <span m="1594000">prime equals y, y prime equals x.</span> <span m="1599000">This is very easily done by elimination, but that is</span> <span m="1603000">forbidden. First of all,</span> <span m="1605000">we write it as a matrix. It's the system x prime equals</span> <span m="1610000">zero, one, one, zero, x.</span> <span m="1613000">Here is my A.</span> <span m="1615000">And so e to the At is going to be --</span> <span m="1621000">A is zero, one, one, zero.</span> <span m="1622000">What we want to</span> <span m="1625000">calculate is we are going to get both solutions at once by</span> <span m="1628000">calculating it one fell swoop e to the At.</span> <span m="1632000">Okay. E to the At equals.</span> <span m="1633000">I am going to actually write out these guys.</span> <span m="1636000">Well, obviously the hard part, the part which is normally</span> <span m="1640000">going to prevent us from calculating this series</span> <span m="1643000">explicitly, by hand anyway, because, as I said,</span> <span m="1646000">the computer can always do it. The value, how do we raise a</span> <span m="1652000">matrix to a high power? You just keep multiplying and</span> <span m="1657000">multiplying and multiplying. That looks like a rather</span> <span m="1661000">forbidding and unpromising activity.</span> <span m="1664000">Well, here it is easy. Let's see what happens.</span> <span m="1668000">If that is A, what is A squared?</span> <span m="1671000">I am going to have to calculate that as part of the series.</span> <span m="1676000">That is going to be zero, one, one, zero times zero,</span> <span m="1680000">one, one, zero, which is one,</span> <span m="1683000">zero, zero, one.</span> <span m="1690000">We got saved. It is the identity.</span> <span m="1693000">Now, from this point on we don't have to do anymore</span> <span m="1697000">calculations, but I will do them anyway.</span> <span m="1701000">What is A cubed? Don't start from scratch again.</span> <span m="1706000">No, no, no. A cubed is A squared times A.</span> <span m="1710000">And A squared is,</span> <span m="1714000">in real life, the identity.</span> <span m="1715000">Of course, you would do all this in your head,</span> <span m="1718000">but I am being a good boy and writing it all out.</span> <span m="1721000">This is I, the identity, times A, which is A.</span> <span m="1724000">I will do one more. What is A to the fourth?</span> <span m="1727000">Now, you would be tempted to say A to the fourth is A</span> <span m="1730000">squared, which is I times I, which is I, but that would be</span> <span m="1734000">wrong. A to the fourth is A cubed</span> <span m="1738000">times A, which is, I have just</span> <span m="1742000">calculated is A times A, right?</span> <span m="1745000">And now that is A squared, which is the identity.</span> <span m="1750000">It is clear, by this argument,</span> <span m="1752000">it is going to continue in the same way each time you add an A</span> <span m="1758000">on the right-hand side, you are going to keep</span> <span m="1762000">alternating between the identity, A, the next one will</span> <span m="1767000">be identity, the next will be A. The end result is that the</span> <span m="1774000">first term of the series is simply the identity;</span> <span m="1779000">the next term of the series is A, but it is multiplied by t.</span> <span m="1784000">I will keep the t on the outside.</span> <span m="1787000">Remember, when you multiply a matrix by a scalar,</span> <span m="1792000">that means multiply every entry by that scalar.</span> <span m="1796000">This is the matrix zero, t, t, zero.</span> <span m="1800000">I will do a couple more terms.</span> <span m="1805000">The next term would be, well, A squared we just</span> <span m="1808000">calculated as the identity. That looks like this.</span> <span m="1812000">Except now I multiply every term by t squared over two</span> <span m="1816000">factorial. All right.</span> <span m="1819000">I'll go for broke. The next one will be this times</span> <span m="1822000">t cubed over three factorial.</span> <span m="1825000">And, fortunately, I have run out of room.</span> <span m="1830000">Okay, let's calculate then.</span> <span m="1854000">What is the final answer for e to At?</span> <span m="1857000">I have an infinite series of two-by-two matrices.</span> <span m="1860000">Let's look at the term in the upper left-hand corner.</span> <span m="1863000">It is one plus zero times t plus one times t squared over</span> <span m="1867000">two factorial plus zero times t.</span> <span m="1871000">It is going to be,</span> <span m="1872000">in other words, one plus t squared over two</span> <span m="1875000">factorial plus the next term,</span> <span m="1878000">which is not on the board but I think you can see,</span> <span m="1881000">is this. And it continues on in the same</span> <span m="1884000">way. How about the lower left term?</span> <span m="1888000">Well, that is zero plus t plus zero plus t cubed over three</span> <span m="1892000">factorial and so on.</span> <span m="1895000">It is t plus t cubed over three factorial plus t to the fifth</span> <span m="1899000">over five factorial.</span> <span m="1902000">And the other terms in the</span> <span m="1904000">other two corners are just the same as these.</span> <span m="1907000">This one, for example, is zero plus t plus zero plus t</span> <span m="1911000">cubed over three factorial.</span> <span m="1915000">And the lower one is one plus zero plus t squared</span> <span m="1919000">and so on. This is the same as one plus t</span> <span m="1924000">squared over two factorial and so on,</span> <span m="1928000">and up here we have t plus t cubed over three factorial</span> <span m="1934000">and so on. Well, that matrix doesn't look</span> <span m="1938000">very square, but it is. It is infinitely long</span> <span m="1942000">physically, but it has one term here, one term here,</span> <span m="1947000">one term here and one term there.</span> <span m="1951000">Now, all we have to do is make those terms look a little</span> <span m="1955000">better. For here I have to rely on the</span> <span m="1958000">culture, which you may or may not posses.</span> <span m="1962000">You would know what these series were if only they</span> <span m="1966000">alternated their signs. If this were a negative,</span> <span m="1970000">negative, negative then the top would be cosine t and</span> <span m="1975000">this would be sine t, but they don't.</span> <span m="1981000">So they are the next best thing.</span> <span m="1984000">They are what? Hyperbolic.</span> <span m="1986000">The topic is not cosine t, but cosh t.</span> <span m="1991000">The bottle is sinh t.</span> <span m="1995000">And how do we know this? Because you remember.</span> <span m="1999000">And what if I don't remember? Well, you know now.</span> <span m="2004000">That is why you come to class.</span> <span m="2015000">Well, for those of you who don't, remember,</span> <span m="2018000">this is e to the t plus e to the negative t.</span> <span m="2024000">It should be over two, but I don't have room to put in</span> <span m="2028000">the two. This doesn't mean I will omit</span> <span m="2032000">it. It just means I will put it in</span> <span m="2035000">at the end by multiplying every entry of this matrix by</span> <span m="2040000">one-half. If you have forgotten what cosh</span> <span m="2044000">t is, it's e to the t plus e to the negative t divided by two.</span> <span m="2052000">And the similar thing for sinh t.</span> <span m="2054000">There is your first explicit exponential matrix calculated</span> <span m="2059000">according to the definition. And what we have found is the</span> <span m="2064000">solution to the system x prime equals y,</span> <span m="2068000">y prime equals x. A fundamental matrix.</span> <span m="2073000">In other words, cosh t and sinh t satisfy both</span> <span m="2076000">solutions to that system. Now, there is one thing people</span> <span m="2080000">love the exponential matrix in particular for,</span> <span m="2084000">and that is the ease with which it solves the initial value</span> <span m="2088000">problem. It is exactly what happens when</span> <span m="2091000">studying the single system, the single equation x prime</span> <span m="2095000">equals Ax, but let's do it in general.</span> <span m="2100000">Let's do it in general. What is the initial value</span> <span m="2103000">problem? Well, the initial value problem</span> <span m="2107000">is we start with our old system, but now I want to plug in</span> <span m="2111000">initial conditions. I want the particular solution</span> <span m="2115000">which satisfies the initial condition.</span> <span m="2118000">Let's make it zero to avoid complications,</span> <span m="2122000">to avoid a lot of notation. This is to be some starting</span> <span m="2126000">value. This is a certain constant</span> <span m="2129000">vector. It is to be the value of the</span> <span m="2133000">solution at zero. And the problem is find what x</span> <span m="2137000">of t is. Well, if you are using the</span> <span m="2141000">exponential matrix it is a joke. It is a joke.</span> <span m="2145000">Shall I derive it or just do it?</span> <span m="2148000">All right. The general solution,</span> <span m="2151000">let's derive it, and then I will put up the</span> <span m="2155000">final formula in a box so that you will know it is important.</span> <span m="2162000">What is the general solution? Well, I did that for you at the</span> <span m="2166000">beginning of the period. Once you have a fundamental</span> <span m="2169000">matrix, you get the general solution by multiplying it on</span> <span m="2173000">the right by an arbitrary constant vector.</span> <span m="2176000">The general solution is going to be x equals e to the At.</span> <span m="2180000">That is my super fundamental</span> <span m="2182000">matrix, found without eigenvalues and eigenvectors.</span> <span m="2187000">And this should be multiplied by some unknown constant vector</span> <span m="2192000">c. The only question is,</span> <span m="2195000">what should the constant vector c be?</span> <span m="2198000">To find c, I will plug in zero. When t is zero,</span> <span m="2202000">here I get x of zero, here I get e to the A times</span> <span m="2207000">zero times c. Now what is this?</span> <span m="2211000">This is the vector of initial conditions?</span> <span m="2215000">What is e to the A times zero? Plug in t equals zero.</span> <span m="2220000">What do you get? I.</span> <span m="2224000">Therefore, c is what? c is x zero.</span> <span m="2231000">It is a total joke. And the solution is,</span> <span m="2237000">the initial value problem is x equals e to the At</span> <span m="2246000">times x zero. It is just what it would have</span> <span m="2252000">been at one variable. The only difference is that</span> <span m="2256000">here we are allowed to put the c out front.</span> <span m="2259000">In other words, if I asked you to put in the</span> <span m="2261000">initial condition, you would probably write x</span> <span m="2264000">equals little x zero times e to the At.</span> <span m="2268000">And you would be tempted to do the same thing here,</span> <span m="2272000">vector x equals vector x zero times e to the At.</span> <span m="2275000">Now, you cannot do that. And, if you try to Matlab will</span> <span m="2280000">hiccup and say illegal operation.</span> <span m="2282000">What is the illegal operation? Well, x is a column vector.</span> <span m="2287000">From the system it is a column vector.</span> <span m="2290000">That means the initial conditions are also a column</span> <span m="2294000">vector. You cannot multiply a column</span> <span m="2297000">vector out front and a square matrix afterwards.</span> <span m="2300000">You cannot. If you want to multiply a</span> <span m="2303000">matrix by a column vector, it has to come afterwards so</span> <span m="2307000">you can do zing, zing.</span> <span m="2311000">There is no zing, you see.</span> <span m="2313000">You cannot put it in front. It doesn't work.</span> <span m="2316000">So it must go behind. That is the only place you</span> <span m="2320000">might get tripped up. And, as I say,</span> <span m="2323000">if you try to type that in using Matlab,</span> <span m="2327000">you will immediately get error messages that it is illegal,</span> <span m="2332000">you cannot do that. Anyway, we have our solution.</span> <span m="2336000">There is our system. Our initial value problem</span> <span m="2340000">anyway is in pink, and its solution using the</span> <span m="2344000">exponential matrix is in green. Now, the only problem is we</span> <span m="2348000">still have to talk a little bit more about calculating this.</span> <span m="2353000">Now, the principle warning with an exponential matrix is that</span> <span m="2357000">once you have gotten by the simplest things involving the</span> <span m="2361000">fact that it solves systems, it gives you the fundamental</span> <span m="2366000">matrix for a system, then you start flexing your</span> <span m="2369000">muscles and say, oh, well, let's see what else</span> <span m="2373000">we can do with this. For example,</span> <span m="2376000">the reason exponentials came into being in the first place</span> <span m="2380000">was because of the exponential law, right?</span> <span m="2383000">I will kill anybody who sends me emails saying,</span> <span m="2386000">what is the exponential law? The exponential law would say</span> <span m="2390000">that e to the A plus B is equal to e to the A times e to the B.</span> <span m="2394000">The law of exponents,</span> <span m="2398000">in other words. It is the thing that makes the</span> <span m="2401000">exponential function different from all other functions that it</span> <span m="2405000">satisfies something like that. Now, first of all,</span> <span m="2408000">does this make sense? That is are the symbols</span> <span m="2411000">compatible? Let's see.</span> <span m="2413000">This is a two-by-two matrix, this is a two-by-two matrix,</span> <span m="2416000">so it does make sense to multiply them,</span> <span m="2419000">and the answer will be a two-by-two matrix.</span> <span m="2421000">How about here? This is a two-by-two matrix,</span> <span m="2424000">add this to it. It is still a two-by-two</span> <span m="2427000">matrix. e to a two-by-two matrix still</span> <span m="2429000">comes out to be a two-by-two matrix.</span> <span m="2433000">Both sides are legitimate two-by-two matrices.</span> <span m="2437000">The only question is, are they equal?</span> <span m="2441000">And the answer is not in a pig's eye.</span> <span m="2445000">How could this be? Well, I didn't make up these</span> <span m="2450000">laws. I just obey them.</span> <span m="2452000">I wish I had time to do a little calculation to show that</span> <span m="2458000">it is not true. It is true in certain special</span> <span m="2463000">cases. It is true in the special case,</span> <span m="2466000">and this is pretty much if and only if, the only case in which</span> <span m="2472000">it is true is if A and B are not arbitrary square matrices but</span> <span m="2477000">commute with each other. You see, if you start writing</span> <span m="2482000">out the series to try to check whether that law is true,</span> <span m="2487000">you will get a bunch of terms here, a bunch of terms here.</span> <span m="2494000">And you will find that those terms are pair-wise equal only</span> <span m="2498000">if you are allowed to let the matrices commute with each</span> <span m="2501000">other. In other words,</span> <span m="2503000">if you can turn AB plus BA into twice AB then</span> <span m="2507000">everything will work fine. But if you cannot do that it</span> <span m="2511000">will not. Now, when do two square</span> <span m="2513000">matrices commute with each other?</span> <span m="2516000">The answer is almost never. It is just a lucky accident if</span> <span m="2522000">they do, but there are three cases of the lucky accident</span> <span m="2528000">which you should know. The three cases,</span> <span m="2532000">I feel justified calling it "the" three cases.</span> <span m="2537000">Oh, well, maybe I shouldn't do that.</span> <span m="2541000">The three most significant examples are,</span> <span m="2546000">example number one, when A is a constant times the</span> <span m="2551000">identity matrix. In other words,</span> <span m="2556000">when A is a matrix that looks like this.</span> <span m="2559000">That matrix commutes with every other square matrix.</span> <span m="2563000">If that is A, then this law is always true</span> <span m="2566000">and you are allowed to use this. Okay, so that is one case.</span> <span m="2571000">Another case, when A is more general,</span> <span m="2574000">is when B is equal to negative A.</span> <span m="2579000">I think you can see that that is going to work because A times</span> <span m="2583000">minus A is equal to minus A times A.</span> <span m="2587000">Yeah, they are both equal to A squared,</span> <span m="2591000">except with a negative sign in front.</span> <span m="2594000">And the third case is when B is equal to the inverse of A</span> <span m="2598000">because A A inverse is the same as A inverse A.</span> <span m="2603000">They are both the identity.</span> <span m="2606000">Of course, A must have an inverse.</span> <span m="2610000">Okay, let's suppose it does. Now, of them this is,</span> <span m="2614000">I think, the most important one because it leads to this law.</span> <span m="2620000">That is forbidden, but there is one case of it</span> <span m="2624000">which is not forbidden and that is here.</span> <span m="2628000">What will it say? Well, that will say that e to</span> <span m="2632000">the A minus A is equal to e to the A times e to</span> <span m="2638000">the negative A. This is true,</span> <span m="2643000">even though the general law is false.</span> <span m="2645000">That is because A and negative A commute with each other.</span> <span m="2650000">But now what does this say? What is e to the zero matrix?</span> <span m="2654000">In other words, suppose I take the matrix that</span> <span m="2658000">is zero and plug it into the formula for e?</span> <span m="2661000">What do you get? e to the zero times t is I.</span> <span m="2664000">It has to be a two-by-two matrix if it is going to be</span> <span m="2669000">anything. It is the matrix I.</span> <span m="2673000">This side is I. This side is the exponential</span> <span m="2678000">matrix. And what does that show?</span> <span m="2681000">It shows that the inverse matrix, the e to the A,</span> <span m="2687000">is e to the negative A. That is a very useful fact.</span> <span m="2693000">This is the main survivor of the exponential law.</span> <span m="2700000">In general it is false, but this standard corollary to</span> <span m="2705000">the exponential law is true, is equal to e to the minus A,</span> <span m="2710000">just what you would dream and hope would be true.</span> <span m="2716000">Okay. I have exactly two and a half</span> <span m="2719000">minutes left in which to do the impossible.</span> <span m="2723000">All right. The question is,</span> <span m="2725000">how do you calculate e to the At?</span> <span m="2731000">You could use series, but it rarely works.</span> <span m="2734000">It is too hard. There are a few examples,</span> <span m="2738000">and you will have some more for homework, but in general it is</span> <span m="2743000">too hard because it is too hard to calculate the powers of a</span> <span m="2749000">general matrix A. There is another method,</span> <span m="2752000">which is useful only for matrices which are symmetric,</span> <span m="2757000">but like that -- Well, it is more than</span> <span m="2761000">symmetric. These two have to be the same.</span> <span m="2764000">But you can handle those, as you will see from the</span> <span m="2767000">homework problems, by breaking it up this way and</span> <span m="2771000">using the exponential law. This would be zero,</span> <span m="2774000">b, b, zero.</span> <span m="2776000">See, these two matrices commute with each other and,</span> <span m="2779000">therefore, I could use the exponential law.</span> <span m="2782000">This leaves all other cases. And here is the way to handle</span> <span m="2786000">all other cases. All other cases.</span> <span m="2790000">In other words, if you cannot calculate the</span> <span m="2793000">series, this trick doesn't work, I have done as follows.</span> <span m="2798000">You start with an arbitrary fundamental matrix,</span> <span m="2801000">not the exponential matrix. You multiply it by its value at</span> <span m="2806000">zero, that is a constant matrix, and you take the inverse of</span> <span m="2811000">that constant matrix. It will have one because,</span> <span m="2815000">remember, the fundamental matrix never has the determinant</span> <span m="2820000">zero. So you can always take its</span> <span m="2824000">inverse-ready value of t. Now, what property does this</span> <span m="2829000">have? It is a fundamental matrix.</span> <span m="2832000">How do I know that? Well, because I found all</span> <span m="2836000">fundamental matrices for you. Take any one,</span> <span m="2841000">multiply it by a square matrix on the right-hand side,</span> <span m="2846000">and you get still a fundamental matrix.</span> <span m="2849000">And what is its value at zero? Well, it is x of zero times x</span> <span m="2857000">of zero inverse. Its value at zero is the</span> <span m="2862000">identity. Now, e to the At has</span> <span m="2868000">these same two properties.</span> <span m="2876000">Namely, it is a fundamental matrix and its value at zero is</span> <span m="2881000">the identity. Conclusion, this is e to the At.</span> <span m="2885000">And that is the garden variety</span> <span m="2888000">method of calculating the exponential matrix,</span> <span m="2891000">if you want to give it explicitly.</span> <span m="2893000">Start with any fundamental matrix calculated,</span> <span m="2896000">you should forgive the expression using eigenvalues and</span> <span m="2900000">eigenvectors and putting the solutions into the columns.</span> <span m="2904000">Evaluate it at zero, take its inverse and multiply</span> <span m="2908000">the two. And what you end up with has to</span> <span m="2912000">be the same as the thing calculated with that infinite</span> <span m="2916000">series. Okay. You will get lots of practice for homework and tomorrow.</span> </p>
