<p><span m="18000">Okay, those are the formulas. You will get all of those on</span> <span m="23000">the test, plus a couple more that I will give you today.</span> </p>
<p><span m="29000">Those will be the basic formulas of the Laplace</span> <span m="33000">transform. If I think you need anything</span> <span m="37000">else, I'll give you other stuff, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="42000">So, I'm going to leave those on the board all period.</span> </p>
<p><span m="46000">The basic test for today is to see how Laplace transforms are</span> <span m="51000">used to solve linear differential equations with</span> <span m="54000">constant coefficients. Now, to do that,</span> <span m="57000">we're going to have to take the Laplace transform of a</span> <span m="62000">derivative. And, in order to make sense of</span> <span m="66000">that procedure, we're going to have to ask,</span> <span m="69000">I apologize in advance, but a slightly theoretical</span> <span m="72000">question, namely, we have to have some guarantee</span> <span m="75000">in advance that the Laplace transform is going to exist.</span> </p>
<p><span m="79000">Now, how could the Laplace transform fail to exist?</span> </p>
<p><span m="83000">Can't I always calculate this? And the answer is,</span> <span m="86000">no, you can't always calculate it because this is an improper</span> <span m="90000">integral. I'm integrating all the way up</span> <span m="93000">to infinity, and you know that improper integrals don't always</span> <span m="98000">converge. You know, if the integrand for</span> <span m="102000">example just didn't have the exponential factor there,</span> <span m="106000">were simply t dt, that it might look like it made</span> <span m="110000">sense, but that integral doesn't converge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="113000">And, anyway, it has no value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="116000">So, I need conditions in advance, which guarantee that</span> <span m="120000">the Laplace transforms will exist.</span> </p>
<p><span m="124000">Only under those circumstances will the formulas make any</span> <span m="127000">sense. Now, there is a standard</span> <span m="129000">condition that's in your book. But, I didn't get a chance to</span> <span m="133000">talk about it last time. So, I thought I'd better spent</span> <span m="136000">the first few minutes today talking about the condition</span> <span m="140000">because it's what we're going to need in order to be able to</span> <span m="143000">solve differential equations. The condition that makes the</span> <span m="147000">Laplace transform definitely exist for a function is that f</span> <span m="151000">of t shouldn't grow too rapidly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="155000">It can grow rapidly. It can grow because the e to</span> <span m="158000">the minus s t is pulling it down,</span> <span m="161000">trying hard to pull it down to zero to make the integral</span> <span m="165000">converge. All we have to do is to</span> <span m="167000">guarantee that it doesn't grow so rapidly that the e to the</span> <span m="172000">minus s t is powerless to pull it down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="174000">Now, the condition is it's what's called a growth</span> <span m="178000">condition. These are very important in</span> <span m="182000">applications, and unfortunately,</span> <span m="184000">it's always taught in 18.01, but it's not always taught in</span> <span m="189000">high school calculus. And, it's a question of how</span> <span m="193000">fast the function is allowed to grow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="196000">And, the condition is universally said this way,</span> <span m="200000">should be of exponential type. So, what I'm defining is the</span> <span m="204000">phrase "exponential type." I'll put it in quotation marks for</span> <span m="209000">that reason. What does this mean?</span> </p>
<p><span m="213000">It's a condition, a growth condition on a</span> <span m="216000">function, says how fast it can get big.</span> </p>
<p><span m="220000">It says that f of t in size, since f of t might get</span> <span m="224000">negatively very large, and that would hurt,</span> <span m="228000">make the integral hard to converge, not likely to</span> <span m="232000">converge, use the absolute value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="234000">In other words, I don't care if f of t is going</span> <span m="238000">up or going down very low. Whichever way it goes,</span> <span m="242000">its size should not be bigger than a rapidly growing</span> <span m="246000">exponential. And, here's a rapidly growing</span> <span m="250000">exponential. c is some positive constant,</span> <span m="254000">for some positive constant c and some positive constant k.</span> </p>
<p><span m="258000">And, this should be true for all values of t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="260000">All t greater than or equal to zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="262000">I don't have to worry about negative values of t because the</span> <span m="266000">integral doesn't care about them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="268000">I'm only doing the integration as t runs from zero to infinity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="273000">In other words, f of t could have been</span> <span m="278000">an extremely wild function, sewn a lot of oats or whatever</span> <span m="284000">functions do for negative values of t, and we don't care.</span> </p>
<p><span m="291000">It's only what's happening from now from time zero onto</span> <span m="297000">infinity. As long as it behaves now,</span> <span m="301000">from now on, it's okay.</span> </p>
<p><span m="305000">All right, so, the way it should behave is by</span> <span m="307000">being an exponential type. Now, to try to give you some</span> <span m="311000">feeling for what this means, these functions,</span> <span m="314000">for example, if k is 100,</span> <span m="316000">do you have any idea what the plot of e to the 100t</span> <span m="320000">looks like? It goes straight up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="323000">On every computer you try to plot it on, e to the 100t</span> <span m="326000">goes like that unless, of course,</span> <span m="329000">you make the scale t equals zero to, over here,</span> <span m="332000">is one millionth. Well, even that won't do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="337000">Okay, so these functions really can grow quite rapidly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="341000">Let's take an example and see what's of exponential type,</span> <span m="346000">and then perhaps even more interestingly,</span> <span m="350000">what isn't. The function sine t,</span> <span m="353000">is that of exponential type? Well, sure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="357000">Its absolute value is always less than or equal to one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="361000">So, it's also this paradigm. If I take c equal to one,</span> <span m="366000">and what should I take k to be? Zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="371000">Take k to be zero, c equals one,</span> <span m="373000">and in fact sine t plays that condition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="378000">Here's one that's more interesting, t to the n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="383000">Think of t to the 100th power.</span> </p>
<p><span m="386000">Is that smaller than some exponential with maybe a</span> <span m="391000">constant out front? Well, t to the 100th power</span> <span m="395000">goes straight up, also.</span> </p>
<p><span m="397000">Well, we feel that if we make the exponential big enough,</span> <span m="401000">maybe it will win out. In fact, you don't have to make</span> <span m="405000">the exponential big. k equals one is good</span> <span m="408000">enough. In other words,</span> <span m="409000">I don't have to put absolute value signs around the t to the</span> <span m="413000">n because I'm only thinking about t as being a</span> <span m="417000">positive number, anyway.</span> </p>
<p><span m="420000">I say that that's less than or equal to some constant M,</span> <span m="424000">positive constant M times e to the t will be good</span> <span m="430000">enough for some M and all t. Now, why is that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="434000">Why is that? The way to think of that,</span> <span m="437000">so, what this proves is that, therefore, t to the n</span> <span m="442000">is of exponential type, which we could have guessed</span> <span m="447000">because after all we were able to calculate its Laplace</span> <span m="451000">transform. Now, just because you can</span> <span m="456000">calculate the Laplace transform doesn't mean it's of exponential</span> <span m="461000">type, but in practical matters, it almost always does.</span> </p>
<p><span m="466000">So, t to the n is of exponential type.</span> </p>
<p><span m="470000">How do you prove that? Well, the weighted secret is to</span> <span m="475000">look at t to the n divided by e to the t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="479000">In other words, look at the quotient.</span> </p>
<p><span m="484000">What I'd like to argue is that this is bounded by some number,</span> <span m="491000">capital M. That's the question I'm asking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="495000">Now, why is this so? Well, I think I can convince</span> <span m="501000">you of it without having to work very hard.</span> </p>
<p><span m="506000">What does the graph of this function look like?</span> </p>
<p><span m="513000">It starts here, so I'm graphing this function,</span> <span m="517000">this ratio. When t is equal to zero,</span> <span m="521000">its value is zero, right, because of the</span> <span m="525000">numerator. What happens as t goes to</span> <span m="528000">infinity? What happens to this?</span> </p>
<p><span m="531000">What does it approach? Zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="534000">And, why? By L'Hop.</span> </p>
<p><span m="536000">By L'Hopital's rule. Just keep differentiating,</span> <span m="541000">reapply the rule over and over, keep differentiating it n</span> <span m="546000">times, and finally you'll have won the numerator down to t to</span> <span m="552000">the zero, which isn't doing anything</span> <span m="557000">much. And, the denominator,</span> <span m="561000">no matter how many times you differentiate it,</span> <span m="565000">it's still t, to the t all the time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="567000">So, by using Lopital's rule n times, you change the top to one</span> <span m="572000">or n factorial, actually; the bottom stays e to</span> <span m="576000">the t, and the ratio clearly</span> <span m="579000">approaches zero, and therefore,</span> <span m="581000">it approached zero to start with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="585000">So, I don't know what this function's doing in between.</span> </p>
<p><span m="588000">It's a positive function. It's continuous because the top</span> <span m="591000">and bottom are continuous, and the bottom is never zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="594000">So, it's a continuous function which starts out at zero and is</span> <span m="598000">positive, and as t goes to infinity, it gets closer and</span> <span m="601000">closer to the t-axis, again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="603000">Well, what does t to the n do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="606000">It might wave around. It doesn't actually.</span> </p>
<p><span m="610000">But, the point is, because it's continuous,</span> <span m="615000">starts at zero, ends at zero,</span> <span m="619000">it's bounded. It has a maximum somewhere.</span> </p>
<p><span m="623000">And, that maximum is M. So, it has a maximum.</span> </p>
<p><span m="630000">All you have to know is where it starts, and where it ends up,</span> <span m="634000">and the fact that it's continuous.</span> </p>
<p><span m="637000">That guarantees that it has a maximum.</span> </p>
<p><span m="639000">So, it is less than some maximum, and that shows that</span> <span m="643000">it's of exponential type. Now, of course,</span> <span m="646000">before you get the idea that everything's of exponential</span> <span m="650000">type, let's see what isn't. I'll give you two functions</span> <span m="654000">that are not of exponential type, for different reasons.</span> </p>
<p><span m="660000">One over t is not of exponential type.</span> </p>
<p><span m="663000">Well, of course, it's not defined that t equals</span> <span m="666000">zero. But, you know,</span> <span m="668000">it's okay for an integral not to be defined at one point</span> <span m="672000">because you're measuring an area, and when you measure an</span> <span m="676000">area, what happened to one point doesn't really matter much.</span> </p>
<p><span m="680000">That's not the thing. What's wrong with one over t is</span> <span m="684000">that the integral doesn't converge at zero times one over</span> <span m="688000">t dt. That integral,</span> <span m="692000">when t is near zero, this is approximately equal to</span> <span m="696000">one, right? If t is zero,</span> <span m="698000">this is one. So, it's like the function,</span> <span m="701000">integral from zero to infinity of one over t,</span> <span m="706000">near zero it's close to,</span> <span m="710000">it's like the integral from zero to someplace of no</span> <span m="714000">importance, dt over t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="717000">But, this does not converge. This is like log t,</span> <span m="721000">and log zero is minus infinity. So, it doesn't converge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="728000">So, one over t is not of exponential type.</span> </p>
<p><span m="731000">So, what's the Laplace transform of one over t?</span> </p>
<p><span m="734000">It doesn't have a Laplace</span> <span m="737000">transform. Well, what if I put t equals</span> <span m="740000">negative n? What about t to the minus one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="743000">Well, that only works for</span> <span m="746000">positive integers, not negative integers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="750000">Okay, so it's not of exponential type.</span> </p>
<p><span m="753000">However, that's because it never really gets started</span> <span m="757000">properly. It's more fun to look at a</span> <span m="760000">function which is not of exponential type because it</span> <span m="765000">grows too fast. Now, what's a function that</span> <span m="769000">grows faster that it grows so rapidly that you can't find any</span> <span m="774000">function e to the k t which bounds it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="778000">A function which grows too rapidly, a simple one is e to</span> <span m="783000">the t squared, grows too rapidly to be of</span> <span m="787000">exponential type. And, the argument is simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="793000">No matter what you propose, it's always,</span> <span m="797000">for the K, no matter how big a number, use Avogadro's number,</span> <span m="802000">use anything you want. Ultimately, this is going to be</span> <span m="807000">bigger than k t no matter how big k is, no matter how big k</span> <span m="812000">is. When is this going to happen?</span> </p>
<p><span m="816000">This will happen if t squared is bigger than k t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="820000">In other words, as soon as t becomes bigger</span> <span m="823000">than k, you might have to wait quite a while for that to</span> <span m="827000">happen, but, as soon as t gets bigger than 10 to the 10 to the</span> <span m="832000">23, this e to the t squared will be</span> <span m="835000">bigger than e to the 10 to the 10 to the 23 times t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="840000">So, e to the t squared,</span> <span m="844000">it's a simple function, a simple elementary</span> <span m="847000">function. It grows so rapidly it doesn't</span> <span m="850000">have a Laplace transform. Okay, so how are we going to</span> <span m="853000">solve differential equations if e to the t squared?</span> </p>
<p><span m="856000">I won't give you any. And, the reason I won't give</span> <span m="859000">you any: because I never saw one occur in real life.</span> </p>
<p><span m="862000">Nature, like sines, cosines, exponentials,</span> <span m="865000">are fine, I've never seen a physical, you know,</span> <span m="868000">this is just my ignorance. But, I've never seen a physical</span> <span m="871000">problem that involved a function growing as rapidly as e to the t</span> <span m="875000">squared. That may be just my ignorance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="880000">But, I do know the Laplace transform won't be used to solve</span> <span m="884000">differential equations involving such a function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="888000">How about e to the minus t squared?</span> </p>
<p><span m="892000">That's different. It looks almost the same,</span> <span m="895000">but e to the minus t squared does this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="898000">It's very well-behaved. That's the curve,</span> <span m="902000">of course, that you're all afraid of.</span> </p>
<p><span m="904000">Don't panic. Okay.</span> </p>
<p><span m="907000">So, I'd like to explain to you now how differential equations,</span> <span m="913000">maybe I should save-- I'll tell you what.</span> </p>
<p><span m="917000">We need more formulas. So, I'll put them,</span> <span m="920000">why don't I save this board, and instead,</span> <span m="924000">I'll describe to you the basic way Laplace transforms are used</span> <span m="930000">to solve differential equations, what are they called,</span> <span m="935000">a paradigm. I'll show you the paradigm,</span> <span m="939000">and then we'll fill in the holes so you have some overall</span> <span m="943000">view of how the procedure goes, and then you'll understand</span> <span m="946000">where the various pieces fit into it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="948000">I think you'll understand it better that way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="951000">So, what do we do? Start with the differential</span> <span m="954000">equation. But, right away,</span> <span m="955000">there's a fundamental difference between what the</span> <span m="958000">Laplace transform does, and what we've been doing up</span> <span m="961000">until now, namely, what you have to start with is</span> <span m="964000">not merely the differential equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="968000">Let's say we have linear with constant coefficients.</span> </p>
<p><span m="972000">It's almost never used to solve any other type of problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="976000">And, let's take second order so I don't have to do,</span> <span m="980000">because that's the kind we've been working with all term.</span> </p>
<p><span m="985000">But, it's allowed to be inhomogeneous,</span> <span m="988000">so, f of t. Let's call the something else,</span> <span m="992000">another letter, h of t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="996000">I'll want f of t for the function I'm taking the</span> <span m="999000">Laplace transform of. All right, now,</span> <span m="1002000">the difference is that up to now, you know techniques for</span> <span m="1005000">solving this just as it stands. The Laplace transform does not</span> <span m="1010000">know how to solve this just doesn't stands.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1012000">The Laplace transform must have an initial value problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1016000">In other words, you must supply from the</span> <span m="1019000">beginning the initial conditions that the y is to satisfy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1024000">Now, I don't want to say any specific numbers,</span> <span m="1026000">so I'll use generic numbers. Well, but look,</span> <span m="1028000">what do we do if we get a problem and there are no initial</span> <span m="1032000">conditions; does that mean we can't use the Laplace transform?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1035000">No, of course you can use it. But, you will just have to</span> <span m="1038000">assume the initial conditions are on the numbers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1041000">You'll say it but the initial conditions be y sub zero</span> <span m="1044000">and y zero prime, or whatever,</span> <span m="1046000">a and b, whatever you want to call it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1050000">And now, the answer, then, will involve the a and</span> <span m="1054000">the b or the y zero and the y zero prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1058000">But, you must, at least, give lip service to</span> <span m="1062000">the initial conditions, whereas before we didn't have</span> <span m="1066000">to do that. Now, depending on your point of</span> <span m="1070000">view, that's a grave defect, or it is, so what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1074000">Let's adopt the so what point of view.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1077000">So, there's our problem. It's an initial value problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1083000">How is it solved by the Laplace transform?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1085000">Well, the idea is you take the Laplace transform of this</span> <span m="1089000">differential equation and the initial conditions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1092000">So, I'm going to explain to you how to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1095000">Not right now, because we're going to need,</span> <span m="1097000">first, the Laplace transform of a derivative,</span> <span m="1100000">the formula for that. You don't know that yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1103000">But when you do know it, you will be able to take the</span> <span m="1106000">Laplace transform of the initial value problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1109000">So, I'll put the little l here, and what comes out is,</span> <span m="1112000">well, y of t is the solution to the original</span> <span m="1116000">problem. If y of t is the</span> <span m="1119000">function which satisfies that equation and these initial</span> <span m="1123000">conditions, its Laplace transform, let's call it capital</span> <span m="1128000">Y, that's our standard notation, but it's going to be of a new</span> <span m="1132000">variable, s. So, when I take the Laplace</span> <span m="1135000">transform of the differential equation with the initial</span> <span m="1139000">conditions, what comes out is an algebraic-- the emphasis is on</span> <span m="1144000">algebraic: no derivatives, no transcendental functions,</span> <span m="1148000">nothing like that, an algebraic equation,</span> <span m="1151000">m Y of s.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1162000">And, now what? Well, now, in the domain of s,</span> <span m="1165000">it's easy to solve this algebraic equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1168000">Not all algebraic equations are easy to solve for the capital Y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1173000">But, the ones you will get will always be, not because I am</span> <span m="1177000">making life easy for you, but that's the way the Laplace</span> <span m="1182000">transform works. So, you will solve it for Y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1185000">And, the answer will always come out to be Y equals,</span> <span m="1189000">Y of s equals some rational function,</span> <span m="1192000">some quotient of polynomials in s, a polynomial in s divided by</span> <span m="1197000">some other polynomial in s.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1209000">And, now what? Well, this is the Laplace</span> <span m="1212000">transform of the answer. This is the Laplace transform</span> <span m="1217000">of the solution we are looking for.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1220000">So, the final step is to go backwards by taking the inverse</span> <span m="1225000">Laplace transform of this guy. And, what will you get?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1230000">Well, you will get y equals the y of t that we are</span> <span m="1235000">looking for. It's really a wildly improbable</span> <span m="1239000">procedure. In other words,</span> <span m="1241000">instead of going from here to here, you have to imagine</span> <span m="1245000">there's a mountain here. And, the only way to get around</span> <span m="1248000">it is to go, first, here, and then cross the stream</span> <span m="1251000">here, and then go back up, and go back up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1254000">It looks like a senseless procedure, what do they call it,</span> <span m="1258000">going around Robin Hood's barn, it was called when I was a,</span> <span m="1261000">I don't know why it's called that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1265000">But that's what we used to call it; not Laplace transform.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1269000">That was just a generic thing when you had to do something</span> <span m="1274000">like this. But, the answer is that it's</span> <span m="1278000">hard to go from here to here, but trivial to go from here to</span> <span m="1283000">here. This solution step is the</span> <span m="1285000">easiest step of all. This is not very hard.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1289000">It's easy, in fact. This is easy and</span> <span m="1293000">straightforward. This is trivial,</span> <span m="1296000">essentially, yeah, trivial.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1298000">But, this step is the hard step.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1301000">This is where you have to use partial fractions,</span> <span m="1305000">look up things in the table to get back there so that most of</span> <span m="1310000">the work of the procedure isn't going from here to here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1315000">Going from here to there is a breeze.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1320000">Okay, now, in order to implement this,</span> <span m="1322000">what is it we have to do? Well, the basic thing is I have</span> <span m="1325000">to explain to you, you already know at least a</span> <span m="1328000">little bit, a reasonable amount of technique for taking that</span> <span m="1332000">step if you went to recitation yesterday and practiced a little</span> <span m="1336000">bit. This part, I assure you,</span> <span m="1337000">is nothing. So, all I have to do now is</span> <span m="1340000">explain to you how to take the Laplace transform of the</span> <span m="1343000">differential equation. And, that really means,</span> <span m="1346000">how do you take the Laplace transform of a derivative?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1351000">So, that's our problem. What I want to form,</span> <span m="1355000">in other words, is a formula for the Laplace</span> <span m="1359000">transform f prime of t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1363000">Now, in terms of what? Well, since f is an arbitrary</span> <span m="1368000">function, the only thing I could hope for is somehow to express</span> <span m="1374000">the Laplace transform of the derivative in terms of the</span> <span m="1380000">Laplace transform of the original function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1386000">So, that's what I'm aiming for. Okay, where are we going to</span> <span m="1390000">start? Well, starting is easy because</span> <span m="1392000">we know nothing. If you don't know anything,</span> <span m="1395000">then there's no place to start but the definition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1398000">Since I know nothing whatever about the function f of t,</span> <span m="1402000">and I want to calculate the Laplace transform,</span> <span m="1406000">I'd better start with the definition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1410000">Whatever this is, it's the integral from zero to</span> <span m="1413000">infinity of e to the minus s t times f prime of t dt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1419000">Now, what am I looking for? I'm looking for somehow to</span> <span m="1423000">transform this so that what appears here is not</span> <span m="1427000">f prime of t, which I'm clueless about, but f of t</span> <span m="1430000">because if this were f of t, this expression would be the</span> <span m="1434000">Laplace transform of f of t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1436000">And, I'm assuming I know that. So, the question is how do I</span> <span m="1442000">take this and somehow do something clever to it that</span> <span m="1445000">turns this into f of t instead of f prime of t?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1450000">Now, to first the question that</span> <span m="1453000">way, I hope I would get 100% response on what to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1456000">But, I'll go for 1%. So, what should I do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1460000">I want to change that, so that instead of f prime of t,</span> <span m="1463000">f of t appears there instead.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1467000">What should I do? Integrate by parts,</span> <span m="1471000">the most fundamental procedure in advanced analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1475000">Everything important and interesting depends on</span> <span m="1479000">integration by parts. And, when you consider that</span> <span m="1483000">integration by parts is nothing more than just the formula for</span> <span m="1488000">the derivative of a product read backwards, it's amazing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1493000">It never fails to amaze me, but it's okay.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1496000">That's what mathematics are so great.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1499000">Okay, so let's use integration by parts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1504000">Integration by parts: okay, so, we have to decide,</span> <span m="1506000">of course, there's no doubt that this is the factor we want</span> <span m="1510000">to integrate, which means we have to be</span> <span m="1512000">willing to differentiate this factor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1514000">But that will be okay because it looks practically,</span> <span m="1517000">like any exponential, it looks practically the same</span> <span m="1520000">after you've differentiated it. So, let's do the work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1523000">First step is you don't do the differentiation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1526000">You only do the integration. So, the first step is e to the</span> <span m="1529000">negative s t. And, the integral of f prime of</span> <span m="1534000">t is just f of t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1536000">And, that's to be evaluated between the limits zero and</span> <span m="1540000">infinity. And then, minus,</span> <span m="1542000">again, before you forget it, put down that minus sign.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1545000">The integral between the limits of what you get by doing both</span> <span m="1549000">operations, both the differentiation and the</span> <span m="1552000">integration. So, the differentiation will be</span> <span m="1555000">by using the chain rule. Remember, I'm differentiating</span> <span m="1559000">with respect to t. The variable is t here,</span> <span m="1563000">not s. s is just a parameter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1566000">It's just a constant, a variable constant,</span> <span m="1569000">if you get my meaning. That's not an oxymoron.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1573000">A variable constant: a parameter is a variable</span> <span m="1576000">constant, variable because you can manipulate the little slider</span> <span m="1581000">and make a change its value, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1584000">That's why it's variable. It's not a variable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1588000">It's variable, if you get the distinction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1593000">Okay, well, I mean, it becomes a variable</span> <span m="1595000">[LAUGHTER]. But right now,</span> <span m="1597000">it's not a variable. It's just sitting there in the</span> <span m="1601000">integral. All right, so,</span> <span m="1603000">minus s, e to the negative s t, f of t dt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1607000">Now, this part's easy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1609000">The interesting thing is this expression.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1612000">So, and the most interesting thing is I have to evaluate it</span> <span m="1616000">at infinity. Now, of course,</span> <span m="1618000">that means take the limit as you go towards,</span> <span m="1621000">as you let t goes to infinity. Now, so what I'm interested in</span> <span m="1627000">knowing is what's the limit of that expression?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1630000">I'll write it as f of t divided by e to the s t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1633000">Remember, s is a positive</span> <span m="1636000">number. s t goes to infinity,</span> <span m="1638000">and I want to know what the limit of that is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1641000">Well, the limit is what it is. But really, if that limit isn't</span> <span m="1645000">zero, I'm in deep trouble since the whole process is out of</span> <span m="1649000">control. What will make that limit zero?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1653000">Well, that f of t should not grow faster than e to</span> <span m="1657000">the s t if s is a big enough number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1661000">And now, that's just what will happen if f of t is of</span> <span m="1665000">exponential type. It's for this step right here</span> <span m="1668000">that is the most crucial place at which we need to know that f</span> <span m="1673000">of t is of exponential type. So, that limit is zero since f</span> <span m="1677000">of t is of exponential type, in other words,</span> <span m="1681000">that the value, the absolute value of f of t,</span> <span m="1684000">becomes less than, let's say, put in the c if you</span> <span m="1689000">want, but it's not very important, c e to the k t</span> <span m="1693000">efor all values of t. And, therefore,</span> <span m="1698000">this will go to zero as soon as s becomes bigger than that k.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1702000">In other words,</span> <span m="1703000">if f of t isn't growing any faster than e to the</span> <span m="1707000">k t , then as soon as s is a number,</span> <span m="1710000">that parameter has the value bigger than k,</span> <span m="1713000">this ratio is going to go to zero because the denominator</span> <span m="1717000">will always be bigger than the numerator, and getting bigger</span> <span m="1721000">faster. So, this goes to zero if s is</span> <span m="1725000">bigger than k. At the upper limit,</span> <span m="1728000">therefore, this is zero. Again, assuming that s is</span> <span m="1732000">bigger than that k, the k of the exponential type,</span> <span m="1737000">how about at the lower limit? We're used to seeing zero</span> <span m="1741000">there, but we're not going to get zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1744000">If I plug in t equals zero, this factor becomes one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1749000">And, what happens to that one? f of zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1753000">You mean, I'm going to have to know what f of zero is before I</span> <span m="1758000">can take the Laplace transform of this derivative?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1762000">The answer is yes, and that's why you have to have</span> <span m="1766000">an initial value problem. You have to know in advance</span> <span m="1770000">what the value of the function that you are looking for is at</span> <span m="1774000">zero because it enters into the formula.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1777000">I didn't make up these rules; I'm just following them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1780000">So, what's the rest? The two negatives cancel,</span> <span m="1783000">and you get plus s. It's just a parameter,</span> <span m="1787000">so I can pull it out of the integral.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1789000">I'm integrating with respect to t, and what's left is,</span> <span m="1793000">well, what is left? If I take out minus s,</span> <span m="1796000">combine it there, I get what's left is just the</span> <span m="1799000">Laplace transform of the function I started with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1804000">So, it's F of s. And, that's the magic formula</span> <span m="1810000">for the Laplace transform of the derivative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1815000">So, it's worth putting up on our little list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1820000">So, f prime of t, assuming it's of exponential</span> <span m="1826000">type, has as its Laplace transform, well,</span> <span m="1831000">what is it? Let's put down the major part</span> <span m="1835000">of it is s times whatever the Laplace transform of the</span> <span m="1839000">original function, F of t,</span> <span m="1841000">was. So, I take the original Laplace</span> <span m="1844000">transform. When I multiply it by s,</span> <span m="1846000">that corresponds to taking the derivative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1849000">But there's also that little extra piece.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1851000">I must know the value of the starting value of the function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1855000">This is the formula you'll used to take a Laplace transform of</span> <span m="1860000">the differential equation. Now, but you see I'm not done</span> <span m="1865000">yet because that will take care of the term a y prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1869000">But, I don't know what the Laplace transform of the second</span> <span m="1873000">derivative is. Okay, so, we need a formula for</span> <span m="1876000">the Laplace transform of a second derivative as well as the</span> <span m="1880000">first. Now, the hack method is to say,</span> <span m="1883000">secondary, all right. I've got to do this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1885000">I'll second derivative here, second derivative here,</span> <span m="1889000">what do I do with that? Ah-ha, I integrate by parts</span> <span m="1893000">twice. Yes, you can do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1894000">But that's a hack method. And, of course,</span> <span m="1900000">I know you're too smart to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1905000">What you would do instead is-- How are we going to fill that</span> <span m="1913000">in? Well, a second derivative is</span> <span m="1918000">also a first derivative. A second derivative is the</span> <span m="1927000">first derivative of the first derivative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1934000">Okay, now, we'll just call this glop, something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1942000">So, it's glop prime. What is the formula for the</span> <span m="1951000">Laplace transform of glop prime? It is, well,</span> <span m="1959000">I have my formula. It is the glop prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1963000">The formula for it is s times the Laplace transform of glop,</span> <span m="1970000">okay, glop. Well, glop is f prime of t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1975000">I'm not done yet,</span> <span m="1978000">minus glop evaluated at zero. What's glop evaluated at zero?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1985000">Well, f prime of zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1990000">Now, I don't want the formula in that form,</span> <span m="1993000">but I have to have it in that form because I know what the</span> <span m="1997000">Laplace transform of f prime of t is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2000000">I just calculated that. So, this is equal to s times</span> <span m="2004000">the Laplace transform of f prime of t, which is s times F of s,</span> <span m="2008000">capital F of s, minus f of zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2011000">All that bracket stuff</span> <span m="2014000">corresponds to this guy. And, don't forget the stuff</span> <span m="2018000">that's tagging along, minus f prime of zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2022000">And now, put that all together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2025000">What is it going to be? Well, there's the principal</span> <span m="2029000">term which consists of s squared multiplied by F of s.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2034000">That's the main part of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2036000">And, the rest is the sort of fellow travelers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2040000">So, we have minus s times f of zero,</span> <span m="2044000">little term tagging along. This is a constant times s.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2050000">And then, we've got another one, still another constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2054000">So, what we have is to calculate the Laplace transform</span> <span m="2058000">of the second derivative, I need to know both f of zero</span> <span m="2062000">and f prime of zero, exactly the initial</span> <span m="2067000">conditions that the problem was given for the initial value</span> <span m="2071000">problem. But, notice,</span> <span m="2073000">there's a principal part of it. That's the s squared F of s.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2077000">That's the guts of it,</span> <span m="2079000">so to speak. The rest of it,</span> <span m="2081000">you know, you might hope that these two numbers are zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2084000">It could happen, and often it is made to happen</span> <span m="2087000">and problems to simplify them. And I case, you don't have to</span> <span m="2091000">worry; they're not there. But, if they are there,</span> <span m="2094000">you must put them in or you get the wrong answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2096000">So, that's the list of formulas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2100000">So, those formulas on the top board and these two extra ones,</span> <span m="2106000">those are the things you will be working with on Friday.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2112000">But I stress, the Laplace transform won't be</span> <span m="2117000">a big part of the exam. The exam, of course,</span> <span m="2122000">doesn't exist, let's say a maximum of 20%,</span> <span m="2127000">maybe 15. I don't know,</span> <span m="2129000">give or take a few points. Yeah, what's a point or two?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2137000">Okay, let's solve, yeah, we have time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2141000">We have time to solve a problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2144000">Let's solve a problem. See, I can't touch that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2149000">It's untouchable. Okay, this, we've got to keep.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2174000">Problem? Okay.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2199000">Okay, now you know how to solve this problem by operators.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2203000">Let me just briefly remind you of the basic steps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2207000">You have to do two separate tasks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2210000">You have to first solve the homogeneous equation,</span> <span m="2214000">putting a zero there. That's the first thing you</span> <span m="2218000">learned to do. That's easy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2220000">You could almost do that in your head now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2225000">You get the characteristic polynomial, get its roots,</span> <span m="2228000">get the two functions, e to the t and e to the</span> <span m="2231000">negative t, which are the solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2234000">You make up c1 times one, and c2 times the other.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2238000">That's the complementary function that solves the</span> <span m="2241000">homogeneous problem. And then you have to find a</span> <span m="2244000">particular solution. Can you see what would happen</span> <span m="2247000">if you try to find the particular solution?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2250000">The number here is negative one, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2254000">Negative one is a root of the characteristic polynomial,</span> <span m="2257000">so you've got to use that extra formula.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2260000">It's okay. That's why I gave it to you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2262000">You've used the exponential input theorem with the extra</span> <span m="2266000">formula. Then, you will get the</span> <span m="2268000">particular solution. And now, you have to make the</span> <span m="2271000">general solution. The particular solution plus</span> <span m="2274000">the complementary function, and now you are ready to put in</span> <span m="2278000">the initial conditions. At the very end,</span> <span m="2282000">when you've got the whole general solution,</span> <span m="2285000">now you put in, not before, you put in the</span> <span m="2287000">initial conditions. You have to calculate the</span> <span m="2291000">derivative of that thing and substitute this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2294000">You take it as it stands to substitute this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2297000">You get a pair of simultaneous equations for c1 and c2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2301000">You solve them: answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2302000">It's a rather elaborate procedure, which has at least</span> <span m="2306000">three or four separate steps, all of which,</span> <span m="2309000">of course, must be done correctly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2313000">Now, the Laplace transform, instead, feeds the entire</span> <span m="2317000">problem into the Laplace transform machine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2320000">You follow that little blue pattern, and you come out with</span> <span m="2324000">the answer. So, let's do the Laplace</span> <span m="2327000">transform way. Okay, so, the first step is to</span> <span m="2331000">say, if here's my unknown function, y of t,</span> <span m="2335000">it obeys this law, and here are its starting</span> <span m="2338000">values, a bit of its derivative. What I'm going to take is the</span> <span m="2343000">Laplace transform of this equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2346000">In other words, I'll take the Laplace transform</span> <span m="2349000">of this side, and this side also.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2351000">And, they must be equal because if they were equal to start</span> <span m="2355000">with, the Laplace transforms also have to be equal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2358000">Okay, so let's take the Laplace transform of this equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2362000">Okay, first ID the Laplace transform of the second</span> <span m="2365000">derivative. Okay, that's going to be,</span> <span m="2367000">don't forget the principal terms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2371000">There is some people who get so hypnotized by this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2374000">I just know I'm going to forget this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2376000">So, they read it. Then they forget this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2378000">But that's everything. That's the important part.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2381000">Okay, so it's s times, I'm calling the Laplace</span> <span m="2384000">transform not capital F but capital Y because my original</span> <span m="2388000">function is called little y. So, it's s squared Y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2391000">It's Y of s, but I'm not going to put that,</span> <span m="2394000">the of s in because it just makes the thing look more</span> <span m="2398000">complicated. And now, before you forget,</span> <span m="2402000">you have to put in the rest. So, minus s times the value at</span> <span m="2406000">zero, which is one, minus the value of the</span> <span m="2410000">derivative. But, that's zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2412000">So, this is not too hard a problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2415000">So, minus s minus zero, so I don't have to put that</span> <span m="2419000">in. So, all this is the Laplace</span> <span m="2422000">transform of y double prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2425000">And now, minus the Laplace transform of y,</span> <span m="2429000">well, that's just capital Y. What's that equal to?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2435000">The Laplace transform of the right-hand side.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2440000">Okay, look up the formula. It is e to the negative t,</span> <span m="2445000">a is minus one, so, it's one over s minus minus</span> <span m="2451000">one; so, it is s plus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2457000">This is that. Okay, the next thing we have to</span> <span m="2462000">do is solve for Y. That doesn't look too hard.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2465000">Solve it for y. Okay, the best thing to do is</span> <span m="2468000">put s squared, group all the Y terms together</span> <span m="2471000">unless you're really quite a good calculator.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2474000">Maybe make one extra line out of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2477000">Yeah, definitely do this. And then, the extra garbage I</span> <span m="2481000">refer to as the garbage, this stuff, and this stuff,</span> <span m="2485000">the stuff, the linear polynomials which are tagging</span> <span m="2488000">along move to the right-hand side because they don't involve</span> <span m="2492000">capital Y. So, this we will move to the</span> <span m="2497000">other side. And so, that's equal to (one</span> <span m="2500000">over (s plus one)) plus s.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2504000">Now, you have a basic choice. About half the time,</span> <span m="2508000">it's a good idea to combine these terms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2511000">The other half of the time, it's not a good idea to combine</span> <span m="2516000">those terms. So, how do we know whether to</span> <span m="2519000">do it or not to do it? Experience, which you will get</span> <span m="2523000">by solving many, many problems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2526000">Okay, I'm going to combine them because I think it's a good</span> <span m="2531000">thing to do here. So, what is that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2535000">That's s squared plus s plus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2540000">So, it's s squared plus s plus one divided by s plus one,</span> <span m="2545000">okay? I'm still not done because now</span> <span m="2548000">we have to know, what's Y?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2551000">All right, now we have to think.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2555000">What we're going to do is get Y in this form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2558000">But, I want it in the form in which it's most suited for using</span> <span m="2562000">partial fractions. In other words,</span> <span m="2564000">I want the denominator as factored as I possibly can be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2568000">Okay, well, the numerator is going to be just what it was.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2572000">How should I write the denominator?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2575000">Well, the denominator is going to have the factor s plus one</span> <span m="2579000">in it from here. But after I divide through,</span> <span m="2584000">the other factor will be s squared minus one,</span> <span m="2589000">right? But, s squared minus one is s</span> <span m="2592000">minus one times s plus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2597000">So, I have to divide this by s squared minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2603000">Factored, it's this. So, the end result is there are</span> <span m="2607000">two of these and one of the other.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2612000">And now, it's ready to be used. It's better to be a partial</span> <span m="2616000">fraction. So, the final step is to use a</span> <span m="2620000">partial fraction's decomposition on this so that you can</span> <span m="2624000">calculate its inverse Laplace transform.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2628000">So, let's do that. Okay, (s squared plus s plus</span> <span m="2631000">one) divided by that thing, (s plus one) squared times (s</span> <span m="2636000">minus one) equals s plus</span> <span m="2641000">one squared plus s plus one plus s minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2647000">In the top will be constants,</span> <span m="2652000">just constants. Let's do it this way first,</span> <span m="2655000">and I'll say at the very end, something else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2658000">Maybe now. Many of you are upset.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2661000">Some of you are upset. I know this for a fact because</span> <span m="2665000">in high school, or wherever you learned to do</span> <span m="2668000">this before, there weren't two terms here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2673000">There was just one term, s plus one squared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2676000">If you do it that way,</span> <span m="2679000">then it's all right. Then, it's all right,</span> <span m="2682000">but I don't recommend it. In that case,</span> <span m="2685000">the numerators will not be constants.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2688000">But, if you just have that, then because this is a</span> <span m="2692000">quadratic polynomial all by itself.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2694000">You've got to have a linear polynomial, a s plus b</span> <span m="2699000">in the top, see?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2702000">So, you must have a s plus b here,</span> <span m="2704000">as I'm sure you remember if that's the way you learned to do</span> <span m="2708000">it. But, to do cover-up,</span> <span m="2709000">the best way as much as possible to separate out the</span> <span m="2712000">terms. If this were a cubic term,</span> <span m="2714000">God forbid, s plus one cubed,</span> <span m="2716000">then you'd have to have s plus one cubed,</span> <span m="2720000">s plus one squared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2723000">Okay, I won't give you anything bigger than quadratic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2726000">[LAUGHTER] You can trust me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2729000">Okay, now, what can we find by the cover up method?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2733000">Well, surely this. Cover up the s minus one,</span> <span m="2737000">put s equals one, and I get three divided by two</span> <span m="2742000">squared, four. So, this is three quarters.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2745000">Now, in this,</span> <span m="2748000">you can always find the highest power by cover-up because,</span> <span m="2752000">cover it up, put s equals negative one,</span> <span m="2756000">and you get one minus one plus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2762000">So, one up there, negative one here makes</span> <span m="2764000">negative two here. So, one over negative two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2767000">So, it's minus one half.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2769000">Now, this you cannot determine</span> <span m="2772000">by cover-up because you'd want to cover-up just one of these s</span> <span m="2776000">plus ones. But then you can't put s equals</span> <span m="2779000">negative one because you get infinity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2782000">You get zero there, makes infinity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2784000">So, this must be determined some other way,</span> <span m="2787000">either by undetermined coefficients,</span> <span m="2789000">or if you've just got one thing, for heaven's sake,</span> <span m="2792000">just make a substitution. See, this is supposed to be</span> <span m="2797000">true. This is an algebraic identity,</span> <span m="2800000">true for all values of the variable, and therefore,</span> <span m="2803000">it ought to be true when s equals zero,</span> <span m="2807000">for instance. Why zero?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2808000">Well, because I haven't used it yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2811000">I used negative one and positive one,</span> <span m="2813000">but I didn't use zero. Okay, let's use zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2816000">Put s equals zero. What do we get?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2820000">Well, on the left-hand side, I get one divided by one</span> <span m="2823000">squared, negative. So, I get minus one on the left</span> <span m="2826000">hand side equals, what do I get on the right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2829000">Put s equals zero, you get negative one half.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2832000">Well, this is the number I'm</span> <span m="2835000">trying to find. So, let's write that simply as</span> <span m="2838000">plus c, putting s equals zero. s equals zero here gives me</span> <span m="2841000">negative three quarters.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2843000">Okay, what's c? This is minus a half,</span> <span m="2846000">minus three quarters, is minus five quarters.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2849000">Put it on the other side,</span> <span m="2852000">minus one plus five quarters is plus one quarter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2855000">So, c equals one quarter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2859000">And now, we are ready to do the</span> <span m="2862000">final step. Take the inverse Laplace</span> <span m="2864000">transform. You see what I said when I said</span> <span m="2867000">that all the work is in this last step?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2869000">Just look how much of the work, how much of the board is</span> <span m="2873000">devoted to the first two steps, and how much is going to be</span> <span m="2877000">devoted to the last step? Okay, so we get e to the</span> <span m="2881000">inverse Laplace transform. Well, the first term is the</span> <span m="2885000">hardest. Let's let that go for the</span> <span m="2888000">moment. So, I leave a space for it,</span> <span m="2890000">and then we will have one quarter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2893000">Well, one over s plus one is,</span> <span m="2896000">that's just the exponential formula.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2899000">One over s plus one would be e to the negative t,e to the minus</span> <span m="2904000">one times t. So, it's one quarter e to the</span> <span m="2908000">minus one times t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2912000">And, how about the next thing would be three quarters times,</span> <span m="2916000">well, here it's negative one, so that's e to the plus t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2921000">Notice how those signs work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2924000">And, that just leaves us the Laplace transform of this thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2929000">Now, you look at it and you say, this Laplace transform</span> <span m="2934000">happened in two steps. I took something and I got,</span> <span m="2938000">essentially, one over s squared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2943000">And then, I changed s to s plus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2948000">All right, what gives one over s squared?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2953000">The Laplace transform of what is one over s squared?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2958000">t, you say to yourself, one over s to some power is</span> <span m="2963000">essentially some power of t. And then, you look at the</span> <span m="2968000">formula. Notice at the top is one</span> <span m="2971000">factorial, which is one, of course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2974000">Okay, now, then how do I convert this to one over s plus</span> <span m="2979000">one squared? That's the exponential shift</span> <span m="2984000">formula. If you know what the Laplace</span> <span m="2987000">transform, so the first formula in the middle of the board on</span> <span m="2991000">the top, there, if you know what,</span> <span m="2994000">change s to s plus one, corresponds to</span> <span m="2998000">multiplying by e to the t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3003000">So, it is t times e to the negative t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3006000">Sorry, that corresponds to this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3008000">So, this is the exponential shift formula.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3011000">If t goes to one over s squared, then t e to the</span> <span m="3015000">minus t goes to one over s plus one squared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3020000">Okay, but there's a constant</span> <span m="3022000">out front. So, it's minus one half t e to</span> <span m="3025000">the negative t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3027000">Now, tell me, what parts of this solution,</span> <span m="3030000">oh boy, we're over time. But, notice,</span> <span m="3032000">this is what would have been the particular solution,</span> <span m="3036000">(y)p before, and this is the stuff that</span> <span m="3039000">occurs in the complementary function, but already the</span> <span m="3042000">appropriate constants have been supplied for the coefficients.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3049000">You don't have to calculate them separately.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3052000">They were built into the method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3054000">Okay, good luck on Friday, and see you there.</span> </p>
