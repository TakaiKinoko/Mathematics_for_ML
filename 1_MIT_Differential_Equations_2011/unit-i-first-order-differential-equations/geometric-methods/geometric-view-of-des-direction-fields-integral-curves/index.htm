<p><span m="7000">OK, let's get started. I'm assuming that,</span> <span m="10000">A, you went recitation yesterday, B,</span> <span m="13000">that even if you didn't, you know how to separate</span> <span m="17000">variables, and you know how to construct simple models,</span> <span m="21000">solve physical problems with differential equations,</span> <span m="25000">and possibly even solve them. So, you should have learned</span> <span m="31000">that either in high school, or 18.01 here,</span> <span m="35000">or, yeah. So, I'm going to start from</span> <span m="38000">that point, assume you know that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="42000">I'm not going to tell you what differential equations are,</span> <span m="47000">or what modeling is. If you still are uncertain</span> <span m="51000">about those things, the book has a very long and</span> <span m="56000">good explanation of it. Just read that stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="60000">So, we are talking about first order ODEs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="66000">ODE: I'll only use two acronyms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="68000">ODE is ordinary differential equations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="72000">I think all of MIT knows that, whether they've been taking the</span> <span m="77000">course or not. So, we are talking about</span> <span m="81000">first-order ODEs, which in standard form,</span> <span m="85000">are written, you isolate the derivative of y</span> <span m="89000">with respect to, x, let's say,</span> <span m="91000">on the left-hand side, and on the right-hand side you</span> <span m="96000">write everything else. You can't always do this very</span> <span m="102000">well, but for today, I'm going to assume that it has</span> <span m="107000">been done and it's doable. So, for example,</span> <span m="110000">some of the ones that will be considered either today or in</span> <span m="116000">the problem set are things like y prime equals x over y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="121000">That's pretty simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="125000">The problem set has y prime equals, let's see,</span> <span m="131000">x minus y squared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="135000">And, it also has y prime equals y minus x squared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="142000">There are others,</span> <span m="145000">too. Now, when you look at this,</span> <span m="149000">this, of course, you can solve by separating</span> <span m="155000">variables. So, this is solvable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="159000">This one is-- and neither of these can you separate</span> <span m="163000">variables. And they look extremely</span> <span m="166000">similar. But they are extremely</span> <span m="168000">dissimilar. The most dissimilar about them</span> <span m="172000">is that this one is easily solvable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="174000">And you will learn, if you don't know already,</span> <span m="178000">next time next Friday how to solve this one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="183000">This one, which looks almost the same, is unsolvable in a</span> <span m="186000">certain sense. Namely, there are no elementary</span> <span m="189000">functions which you can write down, which will give a solution</span> <span m="193000">of that differential equation. So, right away,</span> <span m="196000">one confronts the most significant fact that even for</span> <span m="199000">the simplest possible differential equations,</span> <span m="202000">those which only involve the first derivative,</span> <span m="205000">it's possible to write down extremely looking simple guys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="210000">I'll put this one up in blue to indicate that it's bad.</span> </p>
<p><span m="215000">Whoops, sorry, I mean, not really bad,</span> <span m="218000">but recalcitrant. It's not solvable in the</span> <span m="222000">ordinary sense in which you think of an equation is</span> <span m="226000">solvable. And, since those equations are</span> <span m="230000">the rule rather than the exception, I'm going about this</span> <span m="235000">first day to not solving a single differential equation,</span> <span m="240000">but indicating to you what you do when you meet a blue equation</span> <span m="246000">like that. What do you do with it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="251000">So, this first day is going to be devoted to geometric ways of</span> <span m="257000">looking at differential equations and numerical.</span> </p>
<p><span m="261000">At the very end, I'll talk a little bit about</span> <span m="265000">numerical ways. And you'll work on both of</span> <span m="269000">those for the first problem set. So, what's our geometric view</span> <span m="275000">of differential equations? Well, it's something that's</span> <span m="281000">contrasted with the usual procedures, by which you solve</span> <span m="285000">things and find elementary functions which solve them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="289000">I'll call that the analytic method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="292000">So, on the one hand, we have the analytic ideas,</span> <span m="296000">in which you write down explicitly the equation,</span> <span m="299000">y prime equals f of x,y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="304000">And, you look for certain functions, which are called its</span> <span m="307000">solutions. Now, so there's the ODE.</span> </p>
<p><span m="309000">And, y1 of x, notice I don't use a separate</span> <span m="312000">letter. I don't use g or h or something</span> <span m="314000">like that for the solution because the letters multiply so</span> <span m="318000">quickly, that is, multiply in the sense of</span> <span m="320000">rabbits, that after a while, if you keep using different</span> <span m="324000">letters for each new idea, you can't figure out what</span> <span m="327000">you're talking about. So, I'll use y1 means,</span> <span m="332000">it's a solution of this differential equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="337000">Of course, the differential equation has many solutions</span> <span m="343000">containing an arbitrary constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="346000">So, we'll call this the solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="350000">Now, the geometric view, the geometric guy that</span> <span m="354000">corresponds to this version of writing the equation,</span> <span m="360000">is something called a direction field.</span> </p>
<p><span m="366000">And, the solution is, from the geometric point of</span> <span m="369000">view, something called an integral curve.</span> </p>
<p><span m="372000">So, let me explain if you don't know what the direction field</span> <span m="376000">is. I know for some of you,</span> <span m="378000">I'm reviewing what you learned in high school.</span> </p>
<p><span m="381000">Those of you who had the BC syllabus in high school should</span> <span m="385000">know these things. But, it never hurts to get a</span> <span m="388000">little more practice. And, in any event,</span> <span m="391000">I think the computer stuff that you will be doing on the problem</span> <span m="396000">set, a certain amount of it should be novel to you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="401000">It was novel to me, so why not to you?</span> </p>
<p><span m="403000">So, what's a direction field? Well, the direction field is,</span> <span m="407000">you take the plane, and in each point of the</span> <span m="411000">plane-- of course, that's an impossibility.</span> </p>
<p><span m="414000">But, you pick some points of the plane.</span> </p>
<p><span m="416000">You draw what's called a little line element.</span> </p>
<p><span m="421000">So, there is a point. It's a little line,</span> <span m="424000">and the only thing which distinguishes it outside of its</span> <span m="428000">position in the plane, so here's the point,</span> <span m="431000">(x,y), at which we are drawing this line element,</span> <span m="435000">is its slope. And, what is its slope?</span> </p>
<p><span m="438000">Its slope is to be f of x,y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="441000">And now, You fill up the plane with these things until you're</span> <span m="446000">tired of putting then in. So, I'm going to get tired</span> <span m="450000">pretty quickly. So, I don't know,</span> <span m="454000">let's not make them all go the same way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="456000">That sort of seems cheating. How about here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="460000">Here's a few randomly chosen line elements that I put in,</span> <span m="464000">and I putted the slopes at random since I didn't have any</span> <span m="468000">particular differential equation in mind.</span> </p>
<p><span m="470000">Now, the integral curve, so those are the line elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="474000">The integral curve is a curve, which goes through the plane,</span> <span m="478000">and at every point is tangent to the line element there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="484000">So, this is the integral curve. Hey, wait a minute,</span> <span m="487000">I thought tangents were the line element there didn't even</span> <span m="492000">touch it. Well, I can't fill up the plane</span> <span m="495000">with line elements. Here, at this point,</span> <span m="497000">there was a line element, which I didn't bother drawing</span> <span m="502000">in. And, it was tangent to that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="504000">Same thing over here: if I drew the line element</span> <span m="507000">here, I would find that the curve had exactly the right</span> <span m="511000">slope there. So, the point is the integral,</span> <span m="517000">what distinguishes the integral curve is that everywhere it has</span> <span m="523000">the direction, that's the way I'll indicate</span> <span m="527000">that it's tangent, has the direction of the field</span> <span m="532000">everywhere at all points on the curve, of course,</span> <span m="537000">where it doesn't go. It doesn't have any mission to</span> <span m="542000">fulfill. Now, I say that this integral</span> <span m="544000">curve is the graph of the solution to the differential</span> <span m="548000">equation. In other words,</span> <span m="550000">writing down analytically the differential equation is the</span> <span m="554000">same geometrically as drawing this direction field,</span> <span m="558000">and solving analytically for a solution of the differential</span> <span m="562000">equation is the same thing as geometrically drawing an</span> <span m="566000">integral curve. So, what am I saying?</span> </p>
<p><span m="570000">I say that an integral curve, all right, let me write it this</span> <span m="579000">way. I'll make a little theorem out</span> <span m="584000">of it, that y1 of x is a solution to the differential</span> <span m="593000">equation if, and only if, the graph, the curve associated</span> <span m="601000">with this, the graph of y1 of x is an integral curve.</span> </p>
<p><span m="611000">Integral curve of what? Well, of the direction field</span> <span m="614000">associated with that equation. But there isn't quite enough</span> <span m="618000">room to write that on the board. But, you could put it in your</span> <span m="622000">notes, if you take notes. So, this is the relation</span> <span m="625000">between the two, the integral curves of the</span> <span m="628000">graphs or solutions. Now, why is that so?</span> </p>
<p><span m="631000">Well, in fact, all I have to do to prove this,</span> <span m="634000">if you can call it a proof at all, is simply to translate what</span> <span m="638000">each side really means. What does it really mean to say</span> <span m="642000">that a given function is a solution to the differential</span> <span m="645000">equation? Well, it means that if you plug</span> <span m="648000">it into the differential equation, it satisfies it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="652000">Okay, what is that? So, how do I plug it into the</span> <span m="655000">differential equation and check that it satisfies it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="660000">Well, doing it in the abstract, I first calculate its</span> <span m="664000">derivative. And then, how will it look</span> <span m="667000">after I plugged it into the differential equation?</span> </p>
<p><span m="672000">Well, I don't do anything to the x, but wherever I see y,</span> <span m="677000">I plug in this particular function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="680000">So, in notation, that would be written this way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="684000">So, for this to be a solution means this, that that equation</span> <span m="689000">is satisfied. Okay, what does it mean for the</span> <span m="695000">graph to be an integral curve? Well, it means that at each</span> <span m="702000">point, the slope of this curve, it means that the slope of y1</span> <span m="709000">of x should be, at each point, x1 y1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="712000">It should be equal to the slope</span> <span m="718000">of the direction field at that point.</span> </p>
<p><span m="724000">And then, what is the slope of the direction field at that</span> <span m="728000">point? Well, it is f of that</span> <span m="730000">particular, well, at the point,</span> <span m="732000">x, y1 of x. If you like,</span> <span m="735000">you can put a subscript, one, on there,</span> <span m="738000">send a one here or a zero there, to indicate that you mean</span> <span m="742000">a particular point. But, it looks better if you</span> <span m="746000">don't. But, there's some possibility</span> <span m="748000">of confusion. I admit to that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="752000">So, the slope of the direction field, what is that slope?</span> </p>
<p><span m="755000">Well, by the way, I calculated the direction</span> <span m="758000">field. Its slope at the point was to</span> <span m="761000">be x, whatever the value of x was, and whatever the value of</span> <span m="765000">y1 of x was, substituted into the right-hand</span> <span m="769000">side of the equation. So, what the slope of this</span> <span m="772000">function of that curve of the graph should be equal to the</span> <span m="776000">slope of the direction field. Now, what does this say?</span> </p>
<p><span m="781000">Well, what's the slope of y1 of x?</span> </p>
<p><span m="783000">That's y1 prime of x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="785000">That's from the first day of 18.01, calculus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="788000">What's the slope of the direction field?</span> </p>
<p><span m="791000">This? Well, it's this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="792000">And, that's with the right hand side.</span> </p>
<p><span m="794000">So, saying these two guys are the same or equal,</span> <span m="797000">is exactly, analytically, the same as saying these two</span> <span m="801000">guys are equal. So, in other words,</span> <span m="803000">the proof consists of, what does this really mean?</span> </p>
<p><span m="806000">What does this really mean? And after you see what both</span> <span m="809000">really mean, you say, yeah, they're the same.</span> </p>
<p><span m="814000">So, I don't how to write that. It's okay: same,</span> <span m="819000">same, how's that? This is the same as that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="824000">Okay, well, this leaves us the interesting question of how do</span> <span m="832000">you draw a direction from the, well, this being 2003,</span> <span m="838000">mostly computers draw them for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="844000">Nonetheless, you do have to know a certain</span> <span m="847000">amount. I've given you a couple of</span> <span m="849000">exercises where you have to draw the direction field yourself.</span> </p>
<p><span m="854000">This is so you get a feeling for it, and also because humans</span> <span m="859000">don't draw direction fields the same way computers do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="863000">So, let's first of all, how did computers do it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="867000">They are very stupid. There's no problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="872000">Since they go very fast and have unlimited amounts of energy</span> <span m="877000">to waste, the computer method is the naive one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="882000">You pick the point. You pick a point,</span> <span m="885000">and generally, they are usually equally</span> <span m="889000">spaced. You determine some spacing,</span> <span m="892000">that one: blah, blah, blah, blah,</span> <span m="895000">blah, blah, blah, equally spaced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="900000">And, at each point, it computes f of x,</span> <span m="904000">y at the point, finds, meets,</span> <span m="908000">and computes the value of f of (x, y), that function,</span> <span m="914000">and the next thing is, on the screen,</span> <span m="917000">it draws, at (x, y), the little line element</span> <span m="922000">having slope f of x,y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="926000">In other words, it does what the differential</span> <span m="930000">equation tells it to do. And the only thing that it does</span> <span m="936000">is you can, if you are telling the thing to draw the direction</span> <span m="940000">field, about the only option you have is telling what the spacing</span> <span m="943000">should be, and sometimes people don't like to see a whole line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="946000">They only like to see a little bit of a half line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="949000">And, you can sometimes tell, according to the program,</span> <span m="952000">tell the computer how long you want that line to be,</span> <span m="955000">if you want it teeny or a little bigger.</span> </p>
<p><span m="957000">Once in awhile you want you want it narrower on it,</span> <span m="960000">but not right now. Okay, that's what a computer</span> <span m="964000">does. What does a human do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="965000">This is what it means to be human.</span> </p>
<p><span m="968000">You use your intelligence. From a human point of view,</span> <span m="972000">this stuff has been done in the wrong order.</span> </p>
<p><span m="975000">And the reason it's been done in the wrong order:</span> <span m="978000">because for each new point, it requires a recalculation of</span> <span m="982000">f of (x, y).</span> </p>
<p><span m="984000">That is horrible. The computer doesn't mind,</span> <span m="987000">but a human does. So, for a human,</span> <span m="991000">the way to do it is not to begin by picking the point,</span> <span m="995000">but to begin by picking the slope that you would like to</span> <span m="1000000">see. So, you begin by taking the</span> <span m="1002000">slope. Let's call it the value of the</span> <span m="1005000">slope, C. So, you pick a number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1008000">C is two. I want to see where are all the</span> <span m="1011000">points in the plane where the slope of that line element would</span> <span m="1016000">be two? Well, they will satisfy an</span> <span m="1018000">equation. The equation is f of (x,</span> <span m="1022000">y) equals, in general, it will be C.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1027000">So, what you do is plot this, plot the equation,</span> <span m="1030000">plot this equation. Notice, it's not the</span> <span m="1034000">differential equation. You can't exactly plot a</span> <span m="1037000">differential equation. It's a curve,</span> <span m="1040000">an ordinary curve. But which curve will depend;</span> <span m="1044000">it's, in fact, from the 18.02 point of view,</span> <span m="1048000">the level curve of C, sorry, it's a level curve of f</span> <span m="1052000">of (x, y), the function f of x and y corresponding to the level</span> <span m="1057000">of value C. But we are not going to call it</span> <span m="1062000">that because this is not 18.02. Instead, we're going to call it</span> <span m="1068000">an isocline. And then, you plot,</span> <span m="1071000">well, you've done it. So, you've got this isocline,</span> <span m="1076000">except I'm going to use a solution curve,</span> <span m="1080000">solid lines, only for integral curves.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1083000">When we do plot isoclines, to indicate that they are not</span> <span m="1089000">solutions, we'll use dashed lines for doing them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1095000">One of the computer things does and the other one doesn't.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1098000">But they use different colors, also.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1100000">There are different ways of telling you what's an isocline</span> <span m="1103000">and what's the solution curve. So, and what do you do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1106000">So, these are all the points where the slope is going to be</span> <span m="1109000">C. And now, what you do is draw in</span> <span m="1112000">as many as you want of line elements having slope C.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1115000">Notice how efficient that is. If you want 50 million of them</span> <span m="1119000">and have the time, draw in 50 million.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1121000">If two or three are enough, draw in two or three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1125000">You will be looking at the picture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1127000">You will see what the curve looks like, and that will give</span> <span m="1131000">you your judgment as to how you are to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1134000">So, in general, a picture drawn that way,</span> <span m="1137000">so let's say, an isocline corresponding to C</span> <span m="1139000">equals zero. The line elements,</span> <span m="1143000">and I think for an isocline, for the purposes of this</span> <span m="1147000">lecture, it would be a good idea to put isoclines.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1150000">Okay, so I'm going to put solution curves in pink,</span> <span m="1154000">or whatever this color is, and isoclines are going to be</span> <span m="1158000">in orange, I guess. So, isocline,</span> <span m="1161000">represented by a dashed line, and now you will put in the</span> <span m="1165000">line elements of, we'll need lots of chalk for</span> <span m="1168000">that. So, I'll use white chalk.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1172000">Y horizontal? Because according to this the</span> <span m="1174000">slope is supposed to be zero there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1177000">And at the same way, how about an isocline where the</span> <span m="1180000">slope is negative one? Let's suppose here C is equal</span> <span m="1184000">to negative one. Okay, then it will look like</span> <span m="1187000">this. These are supposed to be lines</span> <span m="1189000">of slope negative one. Don't shoot me if they are not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1193000">So, that's the principle. So, this is how you will fill</span> <span m="1196000">up the plane to draw a direction field: by plotting the isoclines</span> <span m="1201000">first. And then, once you have the</span> <span m="1204000">isoclines there, you will have line elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1207000">And you can draw a direction field.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1209000">Okay, so, for the next few minutes, I'd like to work a</span> <span m="1212000">couple of examples for you to show how this works out in</span> <span m="1215000">practice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1234000">So, the first equation is going to be y prime equals minus x</span> <span m="1245000">over y. Okay, first thing,</span> <span m="1253000">what are the isoclines? Well, the isoclines are going</span> <span m="1263000">to be y. Well, negative x over y is</span> <span m="1268000">equal to C. Maybe I better make two steps</span> <span m="1272000">out of this. Minus x over y is equal to C.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1276000">But, of course, nobody draws a curve in that</span> <span m="1279000">form. You'll want it in the form y</span> <span m="1282000">equals minus one over C times x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1286000">So, there's our isocline. Why don't I put that up in</span> <span m="1292000">orange since it's going to be, that's the color I'll draw it</span> <span m="1296000">in. In other words,</span> <span m="1298000">for different values of C, now this thing is aligned.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1302000">It's aligned, in fact, through the origin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1305000">This looks pretty simple. Okay, so here's our plane.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1310000">The isoclines are going to be lines through the origin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1314000">And now, let's put them in, suppose, for example,</span> <span m="1318000">C is equal to one. Well, if C is equal to one,</span> <span m="1326000">then it's the line, y equals minus x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1334000">So, this is the isocline. I'll put, down here,</span> <span m="1343000">C equals minus one. And, along it,</span> <span m="1350000">no, something's wrong. I'm sorry?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1358000">C is one, not negative one, right, thanks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1362000">Thanks. So, C equals one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1364000">So, it should be little line segments of slope one will be</span> <span m="1370000">the line elements, things of slope one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1374000">OK, now how about C equals negative one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1380000">If C equals negative one, then it's the line,</span> <span m="1383000">y equals x. And so, that's the isocline.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1387000">Notice, still dash because these are isoclines.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1391000">Here, C is negative one. And so, the slope elements look</span> <span m="1395000">like this. Notice, they are perpendicular.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1399000">Now, notice that they are always going to be perpendicular</span> <span m="1403000">to the line because the slope of this line is minus one over C.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1410000">But, the slope of the line element is going to be C.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1413000">Those numbers, minus one over C and C,</span> <span m="1416000">are negative reciprocals. And, you know that two lines</span> <span m="1420000">whose slopes are negative reciprocals are perpendicular.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1424000">So, the line elements are going to be perpendicular to these.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1429000">And therefore, I hardly even have to bother</span> <span m="1432000">calculating, doing any more calculation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1435000">Here's going to be a, well, how about this one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1440000">Here's a controversial isocline.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1442000">Is that an isocline? Well, wait a minute.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1445000">That doesn't correspond to anything looking like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1450000">Ah-ha, but it would if I put C multiplied through by C.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1454000">And then, it would correspond to C being zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1458000">In other words, don't write it like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1461000">Multiply through by C. It will read C y equals</span> <span m="1465000">negative x. And then, when C is zero,</span> <span m="1469000">I have x equals zero, which is exactly the y-axis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1475000">So, that really is included. How about the x-axis?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1478000">Well, the x-axis is not included.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1480000">However, most people include it anyway.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1483000">This is very common to be a sort of sloppy and bending the</span> <span m="1487000">edges of corners a little bit, and hoping nobody will notice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1491000">We'll say that corresponds to C equals infinity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1495000">I hope nobody wants to fight about that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1498000">If you do, go fight with somebody else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1502000">So, if C is infinity, that means the little line</span> <span m="1505000">segment should have infinite slope, and by common consent,</span> <span m="1510000">that means it should be vertical.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1512000">And so, we can even count this as sort of an isocline.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1517000">And, I'll make the dashes smaller, indicate it has a lower</span> <span m="1521000">status than the others. And, I'll put this in,</span> <span m="1525000">do this weaselly thing of putting it in quotation marks to</span> <span m="1529000">indicate that I'm not responsible for it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1534000">Okay, now, we now have to put it the integral curves.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1539000">Well, nothing could be easier. I'm looking for curves which</span> <span m="1545000">are everywhere perpendicular to these rays.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1550000">Well, you know from geometry that those are circles.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1555000">So, the integral curves are circles.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1560000">And, it's an elementary exercise, which I would not</span> <span m="1564000">deprive you of the pleasure of. Solve the ODE by separation of</span> <span m="1568000">variables. In other words,</span> <span m="1570000">we've gotten the, so the circles are ones with a</span> <span m="1574000">center at the origin, of course, equal some constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1578000">I'll call it C1, so it's not confused with this</span> <span m="1582000">C. They look like that,</span> <span m="1584000">and now you should solve this by separating variables,</span> <span m="1588000">and just confirm that the solutions are,</span> <span m="1591000">in fact, those circles. One interesting thing,</span> <span m="1596000">and so I confirm this, I won't do it because I want to</span> <span m="1600000">do geometric and numerical things today.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1602000">So, if you solve it by separating variables,</span> <span m="1605000">one interesting thing to note is that if I write the solution</span> <span m="1609000">as y equals y1 of x, well,</span> <span m="1612000">it'll look something like the square root of C1 minus,</span> <span m="1616000">let's make this squared because that's the way people usually</span> <span m="1620000">put the radius, minus x squared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1623000">And so, a solution,</span> <span m="1626000">a typical solution looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1629000">Well, what's the solution over here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1631000">Well, that one solution will be goes from here to here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1635000">If you like, it has a negative side to it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1638000">So, I'll make, let's say, plus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1641000">There's another solution, which has a negative value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1645000">But let's use the one with the positive value of the square</span> <span m="1649000">root. My point is this,</span> <span m="1652000">that that solution, the domain of that solution,</span> <span m="1655000">really only goes from here to here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1658000">It's not the whole x-axis. It's just a limited piece of</span> <span m="1662000">the x-axis where that solution is defined.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1665000">There's no way of extending it further.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1668000">And, there's no way of predicting, by looking at the</span> <span m="1672000">differential equation, that a typical solution was</span> <span m="1676000">going to have a limited domain like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1681000">In other words, you could find a solution,</span> <span m="1684000">but how far out is it going to go?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1687000">Sometimes, it's impossible to tell, except by either finding</span> <span m="1692000">it explicitly, or by asking a computer to draw</span> <span m="1696000">a picture of it, and seeing if that gives you</span> <span m="1699000">some insight. It's one of the many</span> <span m="1702000">difficulties in handling differential equations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1706000">You don't know what the domain of a solution is going to be</span> <span m="1711000">until you've actually calculated it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1716000">Now, a slightly more complicated example is going to</span> <span m="1720000">be, let's see, y prime equals one plus x minus y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1723000">It's not a lot more</span> <span m="1726000">complicated, and as a computer exercise, you will work with,</span> <span m="1731000">still, more complicated ones. But here, the isoclines would</span> <span m="1736000">be what? Well, I set that equal to C.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1740000">Can you do the algebra in your head?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1742000">An isocline will have the equation: this equals C.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1747000">So, I'm going to put the y on the right hand side,</span> <span m="1751000">and that C on the left hand side.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1753000">So, it will have the equation y equals one plus x minus C,</span> <span m="1759000">or a nicer way to write it would be x plus one</span> <span m="1763000">minus C. I guess it really doesn't</span> <span m="1768000">matter. So there's the equation of the</span> <span m="1771000">isocline. Let's quickly draw the</span> <span m="1774000">direction field. And notice, by the way,</span> <span m="1776000">it's a simple equation, but you cannot separate</span> <span m="1779000">variables. So, I will not,</span> <span m="1781000">today at any rate, be able to check the answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1784000">I will not be able to get an analytic answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1787000">All we'll be able to do now is get a geometric answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1790000">But notice how quickly, relatively quickly,</span> <span m="1793000">one can get it. So, I'm feeling for how the</span> <span m="1796000">solutions behave to this equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1800000">All right, let's see, what should we plot first?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1805000">I like C equals one, no, don't do C equals one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1810000">Let's do C equals zero, first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1813000">C equals zero. That's the line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1816000">y equals x plus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1819000">Okay, let me run and get that chalk.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1823000">So, I'll isoclines are in orange.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1827000">If so, when C equals zero, y equals x plus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1832000">So, let's say it's this curve. C equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1838000">How about C equals negative one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1842000">Then it's y equals x plus two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1847000">It's this curve. Well, let's label it down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1853000">So, this is C equals negative one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1857000">C equals negative two would be y equals x, no,</span> <span m="1862000">what am I doing? C equals negative one is y</span> <span m="1868000">equals x plus two. That's right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1872000">Well, how about the other side? If C equals plus one,</span> <span m="1876000">well, then it's going to go through the origin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1880000">It looks like a little more room down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1884000">How about, so if this is going to be C equals one,</span> <span m="1888000">then I sort of get the idea. C equals two will look like</span> <span m="1894000">this. They're all going to be</span> <span m="1897000">parallel lines because all that's changing is the</span> <span m="1902000">y-intercept, as I do this thing. So, here, it's C equals two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1907000">That's probably enough. All right, let's put it in the</span> <span m="1913000">line elements. All right, C equals negative</span> <span m="1917000">one. These will be perpendicular.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1920000">C equals zero, like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1924000">C equals one. Oh, this is interesting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1926000">I can't even draw in the line elements because they seem to</span> <span m="1930000">coincide with the curve itself, with the line itself.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1934000">They write y along the line, and that makes it hard to draw</span> <span m="1938000">them in. How about C equals two?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1940000">Well, here, the line elements will be slanty.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1943000">They'll have slope two, so a pretty slanty up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1946000">And, I can see if a C equals three in the same way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1951000">There are going to be even more slantier up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1954000">And here, they're going to be even more slanty down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1957000">This is not very scientific terminology or mathematical,</span> <span m="1961000">but you get the idea. Okay, so there's our quick</span> <span m="1965000">version of the direction field. All we have to do is put in</span> <span m="1969000">some integral curves now. Well, it looks like it's doing</span> <span m="1973000">this. It gets less slanty here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1975000">It levels out, has slope zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1979000">And now, in this part of the plain, the slope seems to be</span> <span m="1983000">rising. So, it must do something like</span> <span m="1986000">that. This guy must do something like</span> <span m="1988000">this. I'm a little doubtful of what I</span> <span m="1991000">should be doing here. Or, how about going from the</span> <span m="1995000">other side? Well, it rises,</span> <span m="1997000">gets a little, should it cross this?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2000000">What should I do? Well, there's one integral</span> <span m="2003000">curve, which is easy to see. It's this one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2006000">This line is both an isocline and an integral curve.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2012000">It's everything, except drawable,</span> <span m="2015000">[LAUGHTER] so, you understand this is the same</span> <span m="2021000">line. It's both orange and pink at</span> <span m="2025000">the same time. But I don't know what</span> <span m="2029000">combination color that would make.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2033000">It doesn't look like a line, but be sympathetic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2040000">Now, the question is, what's happening in this</span> <span m="2044000">corridor? In the corridor,</span> <span m="2046000">that's not a mathematical word either, between the isoclines</span> <span m="2052000">for, well, what are they? They are the isoclines for C</span> <span m="2058000">equals two, and C equals zero. How does that corridor look?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2063000">Well: something like this. Over here, the lines all look</span> <span m="2069000">like that. And here, they all look like</span> <span m="2073000">this. The slope is two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2076000">And, a hapless solution gets in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2079000">What's it to do? Well, do you see that if a</span> <span m="2083000">solution gets in that corridor, an integral curve gets in that</span> <span m="2089000">corridor, no escape is possible. It's like a lobster trap.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2094000">The lobster can walk in. But it cannot walk out because</span> <span m="2098000">things are always going in. How could it escape?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2103000">Well, it would have to double back, somehow,</span> <span m="2106000">and remember, to escape, it has to be,</span> <span m="2110000">to escape on the left side, it must be going horizontally.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2117000">But, how could it do that without doubling back first and</span> <span m="2120000">having the wrong slope? The slope of everything in this</span> <span m="2124000">corridor is positive, and to double back and escape,</span> <span m="2128000">it would at some point have to have negative slope.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2132000">It can't do that. Well, could it escape on the</span> <span m="2135000">right-hand side? No, because at the moment when</span> <span m="2139000">it wants to cross, it will have to have a slope</span> <span m="2142000">less than this line. But all these spiky guys are</span> <span m="2146000">pointing; it can't escape that way either.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2150000">So, no escape is possible. It has to continue on,</span> <span m="2153000">there. But, more than that is true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2156000">So, a solution can't escape. Once it's in there,</span> <span m="2161000">it can't escape. It's like, what do they call</span> <span m="2164000">those plants, I forget, pitcher plants.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2167000">All they hear is they are going down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2170000">So, it looks like that. And so, the poor little insect</span> <span m="2174000">falls in. They could climb up the walls</span> <span m="2177000">except that all the hairs are going the wrong direction,</span> <span m="2182000">and it can't get over them. Well, let's think of it that</span> <span m="2186000">way: this poor trap solution. So, it does what it has to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2192000">Now, there's more to it than that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2195000">Because there are two principles involved here that</span> <span m="2199000">you should know, that help a lot in drawing</span> <span m="2203000">these pictures. Principle number one is that</span> <span m="2206000">two integral curves cannot cross at an angle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2210000">Two integral curves can't cross, I mean,</span> <span m="2213000">by crossing at an angle like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2216000">I'll indicate what I mean by a picture like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2222000">Now, why not? This is an important principle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2225000">Let's put that up in the white box.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2228000">They can't cross because if two integral curves,</span> <span m="2232000">are trying to cross, well, one will look like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2236000">It's an integral curve because it has this slope.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2240000">And, the other integral curve has this slope.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2244000">And now, they fight with each other.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2247000">What is the true slope at that point?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2252000">Well, the direction field only allows you to have one slope.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2256000">If there's a line element at that point, it has a definite</span> <span m="2260000">slope. And therefore,</span> <span m="2261000">it cannot have both the slope and that one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2264000">It's as simple as that. So, the reason is you can't</span> <span m="2268000">have two slopes. The direction field doesn't</span> <span m="2271000">allow it. Well, that's a big,</span> <span m="2273000">big help because if I know, here's an integral curve,</span> <span m="2277000">and if I know that none of these other pink integral curves</span> <span m="2281000">are allowed to cross it, how else can I do it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2286000">Well, they can't escape. They can't cross.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2289000">It's sort of clear that they must get closer and closer to</span> <span m="2293000">it. You know, I'd have to work a</span> <span m="2296000">little to justify that. But I think that nobody would</span> <span m="2300000">have any doubt of it who did a little experimentation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2304000">In other words, all these curves joined that</span> <span m="2308000">little tube and get closer and closer to this line,</span> <span m="2312000">y equals x. And there, without solving the</span> <span m="2317000">differential equation, it's clear that all of these</span> <span m="2322000">solutions, how do they behave? As x goes to infinity,</span> <span m="2327000">they become asymptotic to, they become closer and closer</span> <span m="2332000">to the solution, x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2334000">Is x a solution? Yeah, because y equals x is an</span> <span m="2338000">integral curve. Is x a solution?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2342000">Yeah, because if I plug in y equals x, I get what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2347000">On the right-hand side, I get one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2350000">And on the left-hand side, I get one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2354000">One equals one. So, this is a solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2358000">Let's indicate that it's a solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2361000">So, analytically, we've discovered an analytic</span> <span m="2366000">solution to the differential equation, namely,</span> <span m="2371000">Y equals X, just by this geometric process.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2377000">Now, there's one more principle like that, which is less</span> <span m="2381000">obvious. But you do have to know it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2384000">So, you are not allowed to cross.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2386000">That's clear. But it's much,</span> <span m="2389000">much, much, much, much less obvious that two</span> <span m="2392000">integral curves cannot touch. That is, they cannot even be</span> <span m="2397000">tangent. Two integral curves cannot be</span> <span m="2400000">tangent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2410000">I'll indicate that by the word touch, which is what a lot of</span> <span m="2419000">people say. In other words,</span> <span m="2423000">if this is illegal, so is this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2428000">It can't happen. You know, without that,</span> <span m="2433000">for example, it might be,</span> <span m="2435000">I might feel that there would be nothing in this to prevent</span> <span m="2439000">those curves from joining. Why couldn't these pink curves</span> <span m="2443000">join the line, y equals x?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2445000">You know, it's a solution. They just pitch a ride,</span> <span m="2449000">as it were. The answer is they cannot do</span> <span m="2452000">that because they have to just get asymptotic to it,</span> <span m="2455000">ever, ever closer. They can't join y equals x</span> <span m="2459000">because at the point where they join, you have that situation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2465000">Now, why can't you to have this?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2469000">That's much more sophisticated than this, and the reason is</span> <span m="2477000">because of something called the Existence and Uniqueness</span> <span m="2484000">Theorem, which says that there is through a point,</span> <span m="2491000">x zero y zero, that y prime equals f of</span> <span m="2498000">(x, y) has only one,</span> <span m="2503000">and only one solution. One has one solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2509000">In mathematics speak, that means at least one</span> <span m="2513000">solution. It doesn't mean it has just one</span> <span m="2516000">solution. That's mathematical convention.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2519000">It has one solution, at least one solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2522000">But, the killer is, only one solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2526000">That's what you have to say in mathematics if you want just</span> <span m="2530000">one, one, and only one solution through the point</span> <span m="2535000">x zero y zero. So, the fact that it has one,</span> <span m="2538000">that is the existence part. The fact that it has only one</span> <span m="2543000">is the uniqueness part of the theorem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2546000">Now, like all good mathematical theorems, this one does have</span> <span m="2551000">hypotheses. So, this is not going to be a</span> <span m="2555000">course, I warn you, those of you who are</span> <span m="2559000">theoretically inclined, very rich in hypotheses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2564000">But, hypotheses for those one or that f of (x,</span> <span m="2568000">y) should be a continuous function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2572000">Now, like polynomial, signs, should be continuous</span> <span m="2577000">near, in the vicinity of that point.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2582000">That guarantees existence, and what guarantees uniqueness</span> <span m="2588000">is the hypothesis that you would not guess by yourself.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2594000">Neither would I. What guarantees the uniqueness</span> <span m="2599000">is that also, it's partial derivative with</span> <span m="2604000">respect to y should be continuous, should be continuous</span> <span m="2610000">near x zero y zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2615000">Well, I have to make a decision.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2618000">I don't have time to talk about Euler's method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2623000">I'll refer you to the, there's one page of notes,</span> <span m="2629000">and I couldn't do any more than just repeat what's on those</span> <span m="2635000">notes. So, I'll trust you to read</span> <span m="2639000">that. And instead,</span> <span m="2642000">let me give you an example which will solidify these things</span> <span m="2649000">in your mind a little bit. I think that's a better course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2657000">The example is not in your notes, and therefore,</span> <span m="2662000">remember, you heard it here first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2667000">Okay, so what's the example? So, there is that differential</span> <span m="2674000">equation. Now, let's just solve it by</span> <span m="2678000">separating variables. Can you do it in your head?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2682000">dy over dx, put all the y's on the left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2684000">It will look like dy over one minus y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2688000">Put all the dx's on the left. So, the dx here goes on the</span> <span m="2692000">right, rather. That will be dx.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2694000">And then, the x goes down into the denominator.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2697000">So now, it looks like that. And, if I integrate both sides,</span> <span m="2703000">I get the log of one minus y, I guess, maybe with a,</span> <span m="2708000">I never bothered with that, but you can.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2712000">It should be absolute values. All right, put an absolute</span> <span m="2717000">value, plus a constant. And now, if I exponentiate both</span> <span m="2723000">sides, the constant is positive. So, this is going to look like</span> <span m="2729000">y. One minus y equals x</span> <span m="2733000">And, the constant will be e to</span> <span m="2736000">the C1. And, I'll just make that a new</span> <span m="2739000">constant, Cx. And now, by letting C be</span> <span m="2742000">negative, that's why you can get rid of the absolute values,</span> <span m="2745000">if you allow C to have negative values as well as positive</span> <span m="2749000">values. Let's write this in a more</span> <span m="2751000">human form. So, y is equal to one minus Cx.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2753000">Good, all right,</span> <span m="2755000">let's just plot those. So, these are the solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2760000">It's a pretty easy equation, pretty easy solution method,</span> <span m="2765000">just separation of variables. What do they look like?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2771000">Well, these are all lines whose intercept is at one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2776000">And, they have any slope whatsoever.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2779000">So, these are the lines that look like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2784000">Okay, now let me ask, existence and uniqueness.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2789000">Existence: through which points of the plane does the solution</span> <span m="2795000">go? Answer: through every point of</span> <span m="2799000">the plane, through any point here, I can find one and only</span> <span m="2804000">one of those lines, except for these stupid guys</span> <span m="2808000">here on the stalk of the flower. Here, for each of these points,</span> <span m="2813000">there is no existence. There is no solution to this</span> <span m="2817000">differential equation, which goes through any of these</span> <span m="2822000">wiggly points on the y-axis, with one exception.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2827000">This point is oversupplied. At this point,</span> <span m="2830000">it's not existence that fails. It's uniqueness that fails:</span> <span m="2834000">no uniqueness. There are lots of things which</span> <span m="2838000">go through here. Now, is that a violation of the</span> <span m="2841000">existence and uniqueness theorem?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2844000">It cannot be a violation because the theorem has no</span> <span m="2848000">exceptions. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a</span> <span m="2851000">theorem. So, let's take a look.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2854000">What's wrong? We thought we solved it modulo,</span> <span m="2857000">putting the absolute value signs on the log.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2860000">What's wrong? The answer: what's wrong is to</span> <span m="2863000">use the theorem you must write the differential equation in</span> <span m="2868000">standard form, in the green form I gave you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2871000">Let's write the differential equation the way we were</span> <span m="2874000">supposed to. It says dy / dx equals one</span> <span m="2877000">minus y divided by x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2882000">And now, I see, the right-hand side is not</span> <span m="2885000">continuous, in fact, not even defined when x equals</span> <span m="2889000">zero, when along the y-axis. And therefore,</span> <span m="2892000">the existence and uniqueness is not guaranteed along the line,</span> <span m="2896000">x equals zero of the y-axis. And, in fact,</span> <span m="2900000">we see that it failed. Now, as a practical matter,</span> <span m="2903000">it's the way existence and uniqueness fails in all ordinary</span> <span m="2908000">life work with differential equations is not through</span> <span m="2912000">sophisticated examples that mathematicians can construct.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2918000">But normally, because f of (x,</span> <span m="2920000">y) will fail to be defined somewhere,</span> <span m="2923000">and those will be the bad points.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2926000">Thanks.</span> </p>
