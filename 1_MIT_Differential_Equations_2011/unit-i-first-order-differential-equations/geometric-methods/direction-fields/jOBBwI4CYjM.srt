DAVID SHIROKOFF: Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome back.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,150
So today, I'd like to tackle
a problem on direction fields.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,290
So given a
differential equation,

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,160
y prime equals
negative y divided

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,400
by x squared plus
y squared, we're

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,080
asked to first sketch
the direction field.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,650
And then secondly,
given the curve

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,980
that goes through
y(0) equal to 1,

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,360
we're asked several
questions about it.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,820
Why is y of x greater than
0 for x greater than 0?

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,690
And then, why is
y of x decreasing

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,804
for x greater than 0?

14
00:00:34,804 --> 00:00:37,470
So I'll let you think about this
for a moment and I'll get back.

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:47,990
Hi, everyone.

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,650
Welcome back.

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,590
OK, so to start
off this problem,

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,880
we're asked to sketch
the direction field.

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,150
Now when asked to sketch
a direction field,

20
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,441
the first thing to do is to
look at a couple isoclines.

21
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,890
So what is an isocline?

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,760
Well, it's a curve
where the derivative y

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,665
prime is equal to m,
which is some constant.

24
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,690
So what are the isoclines for
this differential equation?

25
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,120
Well, it would be minus
y divided by x squared

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,660
plus y squared equals m.

27
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,350
Now, of particular
interest, there's

28
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,340
a very special isocline, which
is usually the easiest to plot.

29
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,550
And that's a nullcline.

30
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,090
And this is just a special
case where m is equal to 0.

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,410
So what's the
nullcline for this ODE?

32
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:58,350
Well, when m is equal to 0, the
only way that y prime can be 0

33
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,903
is when y is 0.

34
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,710
So the nullcline for
this ODE is y equals 0.

35
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,520
Now, for more general
isoclines, we're

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,440
left with this relation
between x and y.

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,660
And we can massage
this expression

38
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,380
to see exactly what
the isoclines are.

39
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,370
So specifically, I'm
going to multiply through

40
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,780
by x squared plus y squared,
and I'm going to divide by m.

41
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,090
And we see that we have
a quadratic in x and y.

42
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,910
And we have one linear term.

43
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,300
So whenever we have
a relation like this

44
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,350
and we want to understand
what it looks like,

45
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,470
typically the approach is
just to complete the square.

46
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,154
So I'm going to
bring the 1 over m y

47
00:02:48,154 --> 00:02:49,570
to the other side
of the equation.

48
00:02:59,724 --> 00:03:01,140
And I'm going to
combine it with y

49
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,550
squared to complete the square.

50
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,990
And when we do this, we
obtain the following equation.

51
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,980
And we recognize this equation
as the equation for a circle.

52
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,280
Specifically, it's
a circle that's

53
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,930
centered at x is equal to 0
and y is equal to negative 1

54
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,520
over 2m.

55
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,340
And in addition, the
circle has a radius

56
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,660
r squared is equal to 1
over 4m squared, which

57
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,900
means its radius is 1 over 2
times the absolute value of m.

58
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,020
OK, so why don't we take a look
and plot a couple isoclines?

59
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,099
So as I mentioned before,
typically the first isocline

60
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,640
that we should plot
is the nullcline,

61
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,420
which is m is equal to 0.

62
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,810
And we know that this
is y is equal to 0.

63
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,370
So all along the
line y is equal to 0,

64
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:32,090
I'm just going to draw dashes
that correspond to a slope of y

65
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,050
is equal to 0.

66
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,790
For the other isoclines, we just
have to pick some values of m

67
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,760
and start plotting.

68
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,170
So I'll take the value m
is equal to negative 1.

69
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,650
And when m is equal
to negative 1,

70
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,230
we have a circle which
is centered at 0 and 1/2

71
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,090
with radius 1/2.

72
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,030
So here's 1/2.

73
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,910
Here's 1.

74
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,650
And at every point
along the circle,

75
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:16,310
we just draw a little
slope of negative 1.

76
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,480
So at every point
along this curve,

77
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,320
the solution has
slope negative 1.

78
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:30,800
Now, in addition, we can also
get another circle, which

79
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,200
is centered at negative 1/2.

80
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,970
And this corresponds
to the isocline of m

81
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,850
is equal to plus 1.

82
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,050
And every point on this
circle has slope plus 1.

83
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,370
Those should all be the same.

84
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,280
And now we can pick
some other values of m.

85
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,520
So for example, m is equal to 2.

86
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,670
If m is equal to 2,
then we have a circle

87
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,330
which is centered at
negative 1/4 and radius 1/4.

88
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,790
So it might look
something like this.

89
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,050
And m is equal to negative 2
might look something like this.

90
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,640
So this is m is
equal to negative 2.

91
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,966
This is m is equal to 2.

92
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,214
And the slope on this curve
is going to be steeper.

93
00:06:28,214 --> 00:06:29,380
It's going to be negative 2.

94
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,530
And the same goes
for this circle.

95
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,570
And then lastly, I
can draw a sketch of m

96
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:47,040
is equal to 3/4, which would
go up something like this.

97
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,470
Sorry, m is equal
to negative 3/4.

98
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,300
And that would have a slightly
weaker slope like this.

99
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,080
So notice how the
collection of isoclines

100
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,030
are a family of circles that
all are tangent to the origin.

101
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,560
And in fact, if
we think about it,

102
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,840
the nullcline, the
m equal 0 line,

103
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,600
is actually, in
some sense, a limit

104
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,400
circle where we take the
radius in the center going

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,310
to infinity.

106
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,310
So as the circles become
larger and larger,

107
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,030
they tend to approach
this line y equals 0.

108
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,820
So this concludes part one.

109
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,200
So for part two, we're now
asked several questions

110
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,450
about the curve which goes
through y(0) is equal to 1.

111
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,990
So I'll just sketch what this
solution curve might look like.

112
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,242
And it's going to start off
at a slope of negative 1.

113
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:48,200
And then it's going to
hit these circles, which

114
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,340
have a steeper slope.

115
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,450
And then eventually
it's going to go

116
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,116
through the circles
with a steeper slope

117
00:07:55,116 --> 00:07:58,350
and come back to the circle
that has slope negative 1.

118
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,660
And eventually, decay outwards.

119
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,820
So this is what the solution
curve might look like.

120
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:12,080
I'm just sketching this to
set up parts 2a and 2b here.

121
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,990
OK, so why is y of x
always bigger than 0

122
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,500
for x greater than 0?

123
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,060
Well, we see that
this solution curve

124
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,650
stays in the upper half plane.

125
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:35,299
And we note that y is equal
to 0, which is the nullcline,

126
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,080
is actually a very
special curve.

127
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,330
Not only is it the nullcline,
but it's actually a solution

128
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,010
to the differential equation.

129
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,650
So if we look back at the
differential equation,

130
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,244
we see that y is equal
to 0 has zero derivative.

131
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:50,410
And the right-hand side of
the differential equation

132
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,760
is also 0.

133
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,690
So this is not only a
nullcline, but it's a solution

134
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,270
to the differential equation.

135
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,580
Note that this is
extremely special.

136
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,140
In no way does
every nullcline have

137
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,060
to be a solution to a
differential equation.

138
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,690
But in this case, we get lucky.

139
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,560
Now we know from
the theory of ODEs

140
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,740
that solution
curves can't cross.

141
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,900
So a solution curve that
starts in the upper half plane

142
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,540
can't cross another
solution, which in this case

143
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,700
is the y equals 0 curve.

144
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,650
Hence, it must be
bounded in the upper half

145
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,270
plane for all x bigger than 0.

146
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,500
The second part, why
is y of x decreasing

147
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,800
for x greater than 0?

148
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,105
Well, what we have
to look at-- so

149
00:09:31,105 --> 00:09:33,050
I'll just write in here part 2.

150
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,840
We have to look at
the sign of y prime.

151
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,340
Now y prime is equal
to negative y divided

152
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,590
by x squared plus y squared.

153
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,730
So as I've just
argued, a solution

154
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,650
that starts in the
upper half plane

155
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,880
and goes through the point
y of 0 is equal to 1,

156
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,600
stays in the upper half plane
for all x bigger than 0.

157
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,150
What this means is
that the solution curve

158
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,570
has y bigger than 0 for
all x bigger than 0.

159
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,940
So that means the numerator
is always positive.

160
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,130
The denominator is
also always positive.

161
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,940
So we have negative
a positive number

162
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,770
divided by a positive number.

163
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:24,120
And so this quantity is always
going to be less than 0.

164
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,940
So for x bigger than
0, y prime is always

165
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,500
going to be less than 0.

166
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,390
Hence, the solution
that starts at y of 0

167
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,370
is equal to 1 is going to
monotonically decay to y

168
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,110
is equal to 0.

169
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,810
OK?

170
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,840
So this concludes the problem.

171
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,250
Now just to recap,
we were given an ODE.

172
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,180
The standard approach when
sketching direction fields

173
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,020
is to pick a few nullclines.

174
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,560
Or to pick a few isoclines.

175
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,010
And specifically
pick the nullcline.

176
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,500
Sketch the isoclines.

177
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,780
And then, if you're asked
to plot any integral curves

178
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,830
or solutions to the
differential equation,

179
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,540
you just simply
connect the dots.

180
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,720
OK, so I'd like
to conclude here,

181
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,990
and I'll see you next time.
