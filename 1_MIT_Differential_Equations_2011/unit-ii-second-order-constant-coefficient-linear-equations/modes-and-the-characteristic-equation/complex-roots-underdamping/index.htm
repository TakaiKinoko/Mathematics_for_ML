<p><span m="2000">We're going to start.</span> </p>
<p><span m="31000">We are going to start studying today, and for quite a while,</span> <span m="37000">the linear second-order differential equation with</span> <span m="42000">constant coefficients. In standard form,</span> <span m="46000">it looks like, there are various possible</span> <span m="51000">choices for the variable, unfortunately,</span> <span m="55000">so I hope it won't disturb you much if I use one rather than</span> <span m="61000">another. I'm going to write it this way</span> <span m="66000">in standard form. I'll use y as the dependent</span> <span m="69000">variable. Your book uses little p and</span> <span m="72000">little q. I'll probably switch to that by</span> <span m="76000">next time. But, for today,</span> <span m="78000">I'd like to use the most neutral letters I can find that</span> <span m="82000">won't interfere with anything else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="85000">So, of course call the constant coefficients,</span> <span m="88000">respectively, capital A and capital B.</span> </p>
<p><span m="93000">I'm going to assume for today that the right-hand side is</span> <span m="97000">zero. So, that means it's what we</span> <span m="100000">call homogeneous. The left-hand side must be in</span> <span m="104000">this form for it to be linear, it's second order because it</span> <span m="109000">involves a second derivative. These coefficients,</span> <span m="113000">A and B, are understood to be constant because,</span> <span m="117000">as I said, it has constant coefficients.</span> </p>
<p><span m="122000">Of course, that's not the most general linear equation there</span> <span m="126000">could be. In general, it would be more</span> <span m="128000">general by making this a function of the dependent</span> <span m="132000">variable, x or t, whatever it's called.</span> </p>
<p><span m="135000">Similarly, this could be a function of the dependent</span> <span m="138000">variable. Above all, the right-hand side</span> <span m="141000">can be a function of a variable rather than simply zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="145000">In that case the equation is called inhomogeneous.</span> </p>
<p><span m="150000">But it has a different physical meaning, and therefore it's</span> <span m="154000">customary to study that after this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="156000">You start with this. This is the case we start with,</span> <span m="160000">and then by the middle of next week we will be studying more</span> <span m="164000">general cases. But, it's a good idea to start</span> <span m="167000">here. Your book starts with,</span> <span m="169000">in general, some theory of a general linear equation of</span> <span m="173000">second-order, and even higher order.</span> </p>
<p><span m="175000">I'm asking you to skip that for the time being.</span> </p>
<p><span m="180000">We'll come back to it next Wednesday, it two lectures,</span> <span m="183000">in other words. I think it's much better and</span> <span m="186000">essential for your problems at for you to get some experience</span> <span m="190000">with a simple type of equation. And then, you'll understand the</span> <span m="194000">general theory, how it applies,</span> <span m="196000">a lot better, I think.</span> </p>
<p><span m="197000">So, let's get experience here. The downside of that is that</span> <span m="201000">I'm going to have to assume a couple of things about the</span> <span m="205000">solution to this equation, how it looks;</span> <span m="207000">I don't think that will upset you too much.</span> </p>
<p><span m="212000">So, what I'm going to assume, and we will justify it in a</span> <span m="217000">couple lectures, that the general solution,</span> <span m="222000">that is, the solution involving arbitrary constants,</span> <span m="227000">looks like this. y is equal-- The arbitrary</span> <span m="231000">constants occur in a certain special way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="236000">There is c one y one plus c two y two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="243000">So, these are two arbitrary constants corresponding to the</span> <span m="246000">fact that we are solving a second-order equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="249000">In general, the number of arbitrary constants in the</span> <span m="251000">solution is the same as the order of the equation because if</span> <span m="255000">it's a second-order equation because if it's a second-order</span> <span m="258000">equation, that means somehow or other, it may be concealed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="261000">But you're going to have to integrate something twice to get</span> <span m="265000">the answer. And therefore,</span> <span m="266000">there should be two arbitrary constants.</span> </p>
<p><span m="270000">That's very rough, but it sort of gives you the</span> <span m="274000">idea. Now, what are the y1 and y2?</span> </p>
<p><span m="278000">Well, as you can see, if these are arbitrary</span> <span m="282000">constants, if I take c2 to be zero and c1 to be one,</span> <span m="288000">that means that y1 must be a solution to the equation,</span> <span m="293000">and similarly y2. So, where y1 and y2 are</span> <span m="297000">solutions. Now, what that shows you is</span> <span m="302000">that the task of solving this equation is reduced,</span> <span m="305000">in some sense, to finding just two solutions</span> <span m="309000">of it, somehow. All we have to do is find two</span> <span m="312000">solutions, and then we will have solved the equation because the</span> <span m="317000">general solution is made up in this way by multiplying those</span> <span m="322000">two solutions by arbitrary constants and adding them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="326000">So, the problem is, where do we get that solutions</span> <span m="330000">from? But, first of all,</span> <span m="333000">or rather, second or third of all, the initial conditions</span> <span m="338000">enter into the, I haven't given you any initial</span> <span m="342000">conditions here, but if you have them,</span> <span m="345000">and I will illustrate them when I work problems,</span> <span m="349000">the initial conditions, well, the initial values are</span> <span m="354000">satisfied by choosing c1 and c2, are satisfied by choosing c1</span> <span m="359000">and c2 properly. So, in other words,</span> <span m="363000">if you have an initial value problem to solve,</span> <span m="368000">that will be taken care of by the way those constants,</span> <span m="374000">c, enter into the solution. Okay, without further ado,</span> <span m="379000">there is a standard example, which I wish I had looked up in</span> <span m="385000">the physics syllabus for the first semester.</span> </p>
<p><span m="390000">Did you study the spring-mass-dashpot system in</span> <span m="395000">8.01? I'm embarrassed having to ask</span> <span m="399000">you. You did?</span> </p>
<p><span m="400000">Raise your hands if you did. Okay, that means you all did.</span> </p>
<p><span m="404000">Well, just let me draw an instant picture to remind you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="409000">So, this is a two second review.</span> </p>
<p><span m="411000">I don't know how they draw the picture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="414000">Probably they don't draw picture at all.</span> </p>
<p><span m="417000">They have some elaborate system here of the thing running back</span> <span m="422000">and forth. Well, in the math,</span> <span m="424000">we do that all virtually. So, here's my system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="430000">That's a fixed thing. Here's a little spring.</span> </p>
<p><span m="434000">And, there's a little car on the track here,</span> <span m="438000">I guess. So, there's the mass,</span> <span m="441000">some mass in the little car, and motion is damped by what's</span> <span m="447000">called a dashpot. A dashpot is the sort of thing,</span> <span m="452000">you see them in everyday life as door closers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="455000">They're the thing up above that you never notice that prevent</span> <span m="460000">the door slamming shut. So, if you take one apart,</span> <span m="463000">it looks something like this. So, that's the dash pot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="467000">It's a chamber with a piston. This is a piston moving in and</span> <span m="471000">out, and compressing the air, releasing it,</span> <span m="474000">is what damps the motion of the thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="477000">So, this is a dashpot, it's usually called.</span> </p>
<p><span m="482000">And, here's our mass in that little truck.</span> </p>
<p><span m="485000">And, here's the spring. And then, the equation which</span> <span m="489000">governs it is, let's call this x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="491000">I'm already changing, going to change the dependent</span> <span m="495000">variable from y to x, but that's just for the sake of</span> <span m="499000">example, and because the track is horizontal,</span> <span m="503000">it seems more natural to call it x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="507000">There's some equilibrium position somewhere,</span> <span m="510000">let's say, here. That's the position at which</span> <span m="514000">the mass wants to be, if the spring is not pulling on</span> <span m="518000">it or pushing on it, and the dashpot is happy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="522000">I guess we'd better have a longer dashpot here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="526000">So, this is the equilibrium position where nothing is</span> <span m="530000">happening. When you depart from that</span> <span m="533000">position, then the spring, if you go that way,</span> <span m="537000">the spring tries to pull the mass back.</span> </p>
<p><span m="542000">If it goes on the site, the spring tries to push the</span> <span m="547000">mass away. The dashpot,</span> <span m="549000">meanwhile, is doing its thing. And so, the force on the,</span> <span m="554000">m x double prime. That's by Newton's law,</span> <span m="559000">the force, comes from where? Well, there's the spring</span> <span m="564000">pushing and pulling on it. That force is opposed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="569000">If x gets to be beyond zero, then the spring tries to pull</span> <span m="574000">it back. If it gets to the left of zero,</span> <span m="579000">if x gets to be negative, that that spring force is</span> <span m="582000">pushing it this way, wants to get rid of the mass.</span> </p>
<p><span m="586000">So, it should be minus kx, and this is from the spring,</span> <span m="590000">the fact that is proportional to the amount by which x varies.</span> </p>
<p><span m="594000">So, that's called Hooke's Law. Never mind that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="598000">This is a law. That's a law,</span> <span m="601000">Newton's law, okay, Newton,</span> <span m="603000">Hooke with an E, and the dashpot damping is</span> <span m="606000">proportional to the velocity. It's not doing anything if the</span> <span m="611000">mass is not moving, even if it's stretched way out</span> <span m="615000">of its equilibrium position. So, it resists the velocity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="619000">If the thing is trying to go that way, the dashpot resists</span> <span m="624000">it. It's trying to go this way,</span> <span m="626000">the dashpot resists that, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="630000">It's always opposed to the velocity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="632000">And so, this is a dash pot damping.</span> </p>
<p><span m="635000">I don't know whose law this is. So, it's the force coming from</span> <span m="639000">the dashpot. And, when you write this out,</span> <span m="642000">the final result, therefore, is it's m x double</span> <span m="645000">prime plus c x prime, it's important to see where the</span> <span m="649000">various terms are, plus kx equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="652000">And now, that's still not in</span> <span m="656000">standard form. To put it in standard form,</span> <span m="659000">you must divide through by the mass.</span> </p>
<p><span m="663000">And, it will now read like this, plus k divided by m times</span> <span m="667000">x equals zero. And, that's the equation</span> <span m="670000">governing the motion of the spring.</span> </p>
<p><span m="673000">I'm doing this because your problem set, problems three and</span> <span m="677000">four, ask you to look at a little computer visual which</span> <span m="681000">illustrates a lot of things. And, I didn't see how it would</span> <span m="686000">make, you can do it without this interpretation of</span> <span m="690000">spring-mass-dashpot, --</span> <span m="693000">-- but, I think thinking of it of these constants as,</span> <span m="697000">this is the damping constant, and this is the spring,</span> <span m="701000">the constant which represents the force being exerted by the</span> <span m="706000">spring, the spring constant, as it's called,</span> <span m="710000">makes it much more vivid. So, you will note is that those</span> <span m="714000">problems are labeled Friday or Monday.</span> </p>
<p><span m="717000">Make it Friday. You can do them after today if</span> <span m="721000">you have the vaguest idea of what I'm talking about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="727000">If not, go back and repeat 8.01.</span> </p>
<p><span m="730000">So, all this was just an example, a typical model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="736000">But, by far, the most important simple</span> <span m="740000">model. Okay, now what I'd like to talk</span> <span m="745000">about is the solution. What is it I have to do to</span> <span m="750000">solve the equation? So, to solve the equation that</span> <span m="757000">I outlined in orange on the board, the ODE,</span> <span m="761000">our task is to find two solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="764000">Now, don't make it too trivial. There is a condition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="769000">The solution should be independent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="773000">All that means is that y2 should not be a constant</span> <span m="778000">multiple of y1. I mean, if you got y1,</span> <span m="782000">then two times y1 is not an acceptable value for this</span> <span m="786000">because, as you can see, you really only got one there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="790000">You're not going to be able to make up a two parameter family.</span> </p>
<p><span m="795000">So, the solutions have to be independent, which means,</span> <span m="799000">to repeat, that neither should be a constant multiple of the</span> <span m="804000">other. They should look different.</span> </p>
<p><span m="806000">That's an adequate explanation. Okay, now, what's the basic</span> <span m="812000">method to finding those solutions?</span> </p>
<p><span m="814000">Well, that's what we're going to use all term long,</span> <span m="818000">essentially, studying equations of this</span> <span m="821000">type, even systems of this type, with constant coefficients.</span> </p>
<p><span m="826000">The basic method is to try y equals an exponential.</span> </p>
<p><span m="830000">Now, the only way you can fiddle with an exponential is in</span> <span m="834000">the constant that you put up on top.</span> </p>
<p><span m="837000">So, I'm going to try y equals e to the rt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="843000">Notice you can't tell from that what I'm using as the</span> <span m="848000">independent variable. But, this tells you I'm using</span> <span m="853000">t. And, I'm switching back to</span> <span m="856000">using t as the dependent variable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="859000">So, T is the independent variable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="862000">Why do I do that? The answer is because somebody</span> <span m="867000">thought of doing it, probably Euler,</span> <span m="871000">and it's been a tradition that's handed down for the last</span> <span m="876000">300 or 400 years. Some things we just know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="882000">All right, so if I do that, as you learned from the exam,</span> <span m="886000">it's very easy to differentiate exponentials.</span> </p>
<p><span m="890000">That's why people love them. It's also very easy to</span> <span m="894000">integrate exponentials. And, half of you integrated</span> <span m="898000">instead of differentiating. So, we will try this and see if</span> <span m="903000">we can pick r so that it's a solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="907000">Okay, well, I will plug in, then.</span> </p>
<p><span m="909000">Substitute, in other words, and what do we get?</span> </p>
<p><span m="912000">Well, for y double prime, I get r squared e to the rt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="916000">That's y double prime</span> <span m="919000">because each time you differentiate it,</span> <span m="922000">you put an extra power of r out in front.</span> </p>
<p><span m="925000">But otherwise, do nothing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="927000">The next term will be r times, sorry, I forgot the constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="933000">Capital A times r e to the rt,</span> <span m="936000">and then there's the last term, B times y itself,</span> <span m="939000">which is B e to the rt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="941000">And, that's supposed to be equal to zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="944000">So, I have to choose r so that this becomes equal to zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="948000">Now, you see, the e to the rt</span> <span m="951000">occurs as a factor in every term, and the e to the rt</span> <span m="954000">is never zero. And therefore,</span> <span m="957000">you can divide it out because it's always a positive number,</span> <span m="961000">regardless of the value of t. So, I can cancel out from each</span> <span m="967000">term. And, what I'm left with is the</span> <span m="970000">equation r squared plus ar plus b equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="976000">We are trying to find values of</span> <span m="979000">r that satisfy that equation. And that, dear hearts,</span> <span m="984000">is why you learn to solve quadratic equations in high</span> <span m="989000">school, in order that in this moment, you would be now ready</span> <span m="994000">to find how spring-mass systems behave when they are damped.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1001000">This is called the characteristic equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1005000">The characteristic equation of the ODE, or of the system of the</span> <span m="1012000">spring mass system, which it's modeling,</span> <span m="1017000">the characteristic equation of the system, okay?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1022000">Okay, now, we solve it, but now, from high school you</span> <span m="1028000">know there are several cases. And, each of those cases</span> <span m="1034000">corresponds to a different behavior.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1037000">And, the cases depend upon what the roots look like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1042000">The possibilities are the roots could be real,</span> <span m="1045000">and distinct. That's the easiest case to</span> <span m="1049000">handle. The roots might be a pair of</span> <span m="1051000">complex conjugate numbers. That's harder to handle,</span> <span m="1056000">but we are ready to do it. And, the third case,</span> <span m="1060000">which is the one most in your problem set is the most</span> <span m="1065000">puzzling: when the roots are real, and equal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1068000">And, I'm going to talk about those three cases in that order.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1073000">So, the first case is the roots are real and unequal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1077000">If I tell you they are unequal, and I will put down real to</span> <span m="1082000">make that clear. Well, that is by far the</span> <span m="1087000">simplest case because immediately, one sees we have</span> <span m="1091000">two roots. They are different,</span> <span m="1093000">and therefore, we get our two solutions</span> <span m="1097000">immediately. So, the solutions are,</span> <span m="1099000">the general solution to the equation, I write down without</span> <span m="1104000">further ado as y equals c1 e to the r1 t plus c2 e to the r2 t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1114000">There's our solution. Now, because that was so easy,</span> <span m="1118000">and we didn't have to do any work, I'd like to extend this</span> <span m="1122000">case a little bit by using it as an example of how you put in the</span> <span m="1128000">initial conditions, how to put in the c.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1131000">So, let me work a specific numerical example,</span> <span m="1134000">since we are not going to try to do this theoretically until</span> <span m="1139000">next Wednesday. Let's just do a numerical</span> <span m="1144000">example. So, suppose I take the</span> <span m="1147000">constants to be the damping constant to be a four,</span> <span m="1151000">and the spring constant, I'll take the mass to be one,</span> <span m="1156000">and the spring constant to be three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1159000">So, there's more damping here, damping force here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1164000">You can't really talk that way since the units are different.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1171000">But, this number is bigger than that one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1173000">That seems clear, at any rate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1175000">Okay, now, what was the characteristic equation?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1179000">Look, now watch. Please do what I do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1181000">I've found in the past, even by the middle of the term,</span> <span m="1185000">there are still students who feel that they must substitute y</span> <span m="1190000">equals e to the rt, and go through that whole</span> <span m="1193000">little derivation to find that you don't do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1197000">It's a waste of time. I did it that you might not</span> <span m="1202000">ever have to do it again. Immediately write down the</span> <span m="1206000">characteristic equation. That's not very hard.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1210000">r squared plus 4r plus three equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1214000">And, if you can write down its</span> <span m="1217000">roots immediately, splendid.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1220000">But, let's not assume that level of competence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1223000">So, it's r plus three times r plus one equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1229000">Okay, you factor it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1233000">This being 18.03, a lot of the times the roots</span> <span m="1236000">will be integers when they are not, God forbid,</span> <span m="1239000">you will have to use the quadratic formula.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1242000">But here, the roots were integers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1244000">It is, after all, only the first example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1247000">So, the solution, the general solution is y</span> <span m="1250000">equals c1 e to the negative, notice the root is minus three</span> <span m="1254000">and minus one, minus 3t plus c2 e to the</span> <span m="1256000">negative t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1261000">Now, suppose it's an initial value problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1264000">So, I gave you an initial condition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1266000">Suppose the initial conditions were that y of zero were one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1271000">So, at the start,</span> <span m="1273000">the mass has been moved over to the position,</span> <span m="1276000">one, here. Well, we expected it,</span> <span m="1278000">then, to start doing that. But, this is fairly heavily</span> <span m="1282000">damped. This is heavily damped.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1285000">I'm going to assume that the mass starts at rest.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1290000">So, the spring is distended. The masses over here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1293000">But, there's no motion at times zero this way or that way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1297000">In other words, I'm not pushing it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1300000">I'm just releasing it and letting it do its thing after</span> <span m="1304000">that. Okay, so y prime of zero,</span> <span m="1306000">I'll assume, is zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1309000">So, it starts at rest, but in the extended position,</span> <span m="1313000">one unit to the right of the equilibrium position.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1316000">Now, all you have to do is use these two conditions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1322000">Notice I have to have two conditions because there are two</span> <span m="1326000">constants I have to find the value of.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1329000">All right, so, let's substitute,</span> <span m="1331000">well, we're going to have to calculate the derivative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1335000">So, why don't we do that right away?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1338000">So, this is minus three c1 e to the minus 3t minus c2 e to the</span> <span m="1342000">negative t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1347000">And now, if I substitute in at zero, when t equals zero,</span> <span m="1351000">what do I get? Well, the first equation,</span> <span m="1354000">the left says that y of zero should be one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1358000">And, the right says this is one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1361000">So, it's c1 plus c2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1363000">That's the result of substituting t equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1367000">How about substituting?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1369000">What should I substitute in the second equation?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1373000">Well, y prime of zero is zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1376000">So, if the second equation, when I put in t equals zero,</span> <span m="1381000">the left side is zero according to that initial value,</span> <span m="1385000">and the right side is negative three c1 minus c2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1392000">You see what you end up with, therefore, is a pair of</span> <span m="1395000">simultaneous linear equations. And, this is why you learn to</span> <span m="1399000">study linear set of pairs of simultaneous linear equations in</span> <span m="1404000">high school. These are among the most</span> <span m="1406000">important. Solving problems of this type</span> <span m="1409000">are among the most important applications of that kind of</span> <span m="1413000">algebra, and this kind of algebra.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1417000">All right, what's the answer finally?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1420000">Well, if I add the two of them, I get minus 2c1 equals one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1425000">So, c1 is equal to minus one half.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1429000">And, if c1 is minus a half,</span> <span m="1434000">then c2 is minus 3c1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1437000">So, c2 is three halves.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1450000">The final question is, what does that look like as a</span> <span m="1453000">solution? Well, in general,</span> <span m="1454000">these combinations of two exponentials aren't very easy to</span> <span m="1457000">plot by yourself. That's one of the reasons you</span> <span m="1460000">are being given this little visual which plots them for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1464000">All you have to do is, as you'll see,</span> <span m="1466000">set the damping constant, set the constants,</span> <span m="1468000">set the initial conditions, and by magic,</span> <span m="1471000">the curve appears on the screen.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1474000">And, if you change either of the constants,</span> <span m="1480000">the curve will change nicely right along with it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1488000">So, the solution is y equals minus one half e to the minus 3t</span> <span m="1497000">plus three halves e to the negative t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1506000">How does it look?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1511000">Well, I don't expect you to be able to plot that by yourself,</span> <span m="1516000">but you can at least get started.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1519000">It does have to satisfy the initial conditions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1523000">That means it should start at one, and its starting slope is</span> <span m="1528000">zero. So, it starts like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1532000">These are both declining exponentials.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1535000">This declines very rapidly, this somewhat more slowly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1540000">It does something like that. If this term were a lot,</span> <span m="1544000">lot more negative, I mean, that's the way that</span> <span m="1549000">particular solution looks. How might other solutions look?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1554000">I'll draw a few other possibilities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1557000">If the initial term, if, for example,</span> <span m="1560000">the initial slope were quite negative, well,</span> <span m="1564000">that would have start like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1569000">Now, just your experience of physics, or of the real world</span> <span m="1572000">suggests that if I give, if I start the thing at one,</span> <span m="1575000">but give it a strongly negative push, it's going to go beyond</span> <span m="1579000">the equilibrium position, and then come back again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1582000">But, because the damping is big, it's not going to be able</span> <span m="1586000">to get through that. The equilibrium position,</span> <span m="1589000">a second time, is going to look something like</span> <span m="1591000">that. Or, if I push it in that</span> <span m="1594000">direction, the positive direction, that it starts off</span> <span m="1597000">with a positive slope. But it loses its energy because</span> <span m="1601000">the spring is pulling it. It comes and does something</span> <span m="1604000">like that. So, in other words,</span> <span m="1606000">it might go down. Cut across the equilibrium</span> <span m="1609000">position, come back again, it do that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1612000">No, that it cannot do. I was considering giving you a</span> <span m="1615000">problem to prove that, but I got tired of making out</span> <span m="1618000">the problems set, and decided I tortured you</span> <span m="1621000">enough already, as you will see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1625000">So, anyway, these are different possibilities for the way that</span> <span m="1631000">can look. This case, where it just</span> <span m="1634000">returns in the long run is called the over-damped case,</span> <span m="1640000">over-damped. Now, there is another case</span> <span m="1644000">where the thing oscillates back and forth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1650000">We would expect to get that case if the damping is very</span> <span m="1653000">little or nonexistent. Then, there's very little</span> <span m="1657000">preventing the mass from doing that, although we do expect if</span> <span m="1661000">there's any damping at all, we expect it ultimately to get</span> <span m="1665000">nearer and nearer to the equilibrium position.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1668000">Mathematically, what does that correspond to?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1671000">Well, that's going to correspond to case two,</span> <span m="1675000">where the roots are complex. The roots are complex,</span> <span m="1679000">and this is why, let's call the roots,</span> <span m="1683000">in that case we know that the roots are of the form a plus or</span> <span m="1688000">minus bi. There are two roots,</span> <span m="1690000">and they are a complex conjugate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1693000">All right, let's take one of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1696000">What does a correspond to in terms of the exponential?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1700000">Well, remember, the function of the r was,</span> <span m="1704000">it's this r when we tried our exponential solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1710000">So, what we formally, this means we get a complex</span> <span m="1714000">solution. The complex solution y equals e</span> <span m="1718000">to this, let's use one of them, let's say, (a plus bi) times t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1723000">The question is,</span> <span m="1727000">what do we do that? We are not really interested,</span> <span m="1731000">I don't know what a complex solution to that thing means.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1736000">It doesn't have any meaning. What I want to know is how y</span> <span m="1741000">behaves or how x behaves in that picture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1747000">And, that better be a real function because otherwise I</span> <span m="1750000">don't know what to do with it. So, we are looking for two real</span> <span m="1754000">functions, the y1 and the y2. But, in fact,</span> <span m="1757000">what we've got is one complex function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1760000">All right, now, a theorem to the rescue:</span> <span m="1762000">this, I'm not going to save for Wednesday because it's so</span> <span m="1766000">simple. So, the theorem is that if you</span> <span m="1770000">have a complex solution, u plus iv, so each of these is</span> <span m="1776000">a function of time, u plus iv is the complex</span> <span m="1780000">solution to a real differential equation with constant</span> <span m="1785000">coefficients. Well, it doesn't have to have</span> <span m="1789000">constant coefficients. It has to be linear.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1793000">Let me just write it out to y double prime plus A y prime plus</span> <span m="1799000">B y equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1804000">Suppose you got a complex solution to that equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1808000">These are understood to be real numbers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1811000">They are the damping constant and the spring constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1815000">Then, the conclusion is that u and v are real solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1820000">In other words, having found a complex</span> <span m="1823000">solution, all you have to do is take its real and imaginary</span> <span m="1828000">parts, and voila, you've got your two solutions</span> <span m="1831000">you were looking for for the original equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1837000">Now, that might seem like magic, but it's easy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1839000">It's so easy it's the sort of theorem I could spend one minute</span> <span m="1843000">proving for you now. What's the reason for it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1846000">Well, the main thing I want you to get out of this argument is</span> <span m="1850000">to see that it absolutely depends upon these coefficients</span> <span m="1854000">being real. You have to have a real</span> <span m="1856000">differential equation for this to be true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1859000">Otherwise, it's certainly not. So, the proof is,</span> <span m="1863000">what does it mean to be a solution?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1866000">It means when you plug in A (u plus iv) plus,</span> <span m="1870000">prime, plus B times u plus iv,</span> <span m="1874000">what am I supposed to get?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1877000">Zero. Well, now, separate these into</span> <span m="1880000">the real and imaginary parts. What does it say?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1884000">It says u double prime plus A u prime plus B u,</span> <span m="1889000">that's the real part of this expression when I expand it</span> <span m="1895000">out. And, I've got an imaginary</span> <span m="1899000">part, too, which all have the coefficient i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1903000">So, from here, I get v double prime plus i</span> <span m="1906000">times A v prime plus i times B v.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1911000">So, this is the imaginary part. Now, here I have something with</span> <span m="1917000">a real part plus the imaginary part, i, times the imaginary</span> <span m="1922000">part is zero. Well, the only way that can</span> <span m="1925000">happen is if the real part is zero, and the imaginary part is</span> <span m="1931000">separately zero. So, the conclusion is that</span> <span m="1935000">therefore this part must be zero, and therefore this part</span> <span m="1939000">must be zero because the two of them together make the complex</span> <span m="1943000">number zero plus zero i. Now, what does it mean for the</span> <span m="1947000">real part to be zero? It means that u is a solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1951000">This, the imaginary part zero means v is a solution,</span> <span m="1954000">and therefore, just what I said.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1956000">u and v are solutions to the real equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1959000">Where did I use the fact that A and B were real numbers and not</span> <span m="1964000">complex numbers? In knowing that this is the</span> <span m="1967000">real part, I had to know that A was a real number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1971000">If A were something like one plus i,</span> <span m="1974000">I'd be screwed, I mean, because then I couldn't</span> <span m="1977000">say that this was the real part anymore.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1982000">So, saying that's the real part, and this is the imaginary</span> <span m="1987000">part, I was using the fact that these two numbers,</span> <span m="1992000">constants, were real constants: very important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1997000">So, what is the case two solution?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2000000">Well, what are the real and imaginary parts</span> <span m="2006000">of (a plus b i) t? Well, y equals e to the at +</span> <span m="2011000">ibt. Okay, you've had experience.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2017000">You know how to do this now. That's e to the at</span> <span m="2022000">times, well, the real part is, well, let's write it this way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2027000">The real part is e to the at times cosine b t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2031000">Notice how the a and b enter</span> <span m="2034000">into the expression. That's the real part.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2038000">And, the imaginary part is e to the at times the sine of bt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2043000">And therefore,</span> <span m="2047000">the solution, both of these must,</span> <span m="2050000">therefore, be solutions to the equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2053000">And therefore, the general solution to the ODE</span> <span m="2058000">is y equals, now, you've got to put in the</span> <span m="2061000">arbitrary constants. It's a nice thing to do to</span> <span m="2066000">factor out the e to the at.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2069000">It makes it look a little better.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2072000">And so, the constants are c1 cosine bt and c2 sine bt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2079000">Yeah, but what does that look like?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2081000">Well, you know that too. This is an exponential,</span> <span m="2085000">which controls the amplitude. But this guy,</span> <span m="2089000">which is a combination of two sinusoidal oscillations with</span> <span m="2093000">different amplitudes, but with the same frequency,</span> <span m="2097000">the b's are the same in both of them, and therefore,</span> <span m="2101000">this is, itself, a purely sinusoidal</span> <span m="2104000">oscillation. So, in other words,</span> <span m="2109000">I don't have room to write it, but it's equal to,</span> <span m="2115000">you know. It's a good example of where</span> <span m="2120000">you'd use that trigonometric identity I spent time on before</span> <span m="2127000">the exam. Okay, let's work a quick</span> <span m="2131000">example just to see how this works out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2133000">Well, let's get rid of this. Okay, let's now make the</span> <span m="2136000">damping, since this is showing oscillations,</span> <span m="2139000">it must correspond to the case where the damping is less strong</span> <span m="2142000">compared with the spring constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2144000">So, the theorem is that if you have a complex solution,</span> <span m="2147000">u plus iv, so each of these is a function of time,</span> <span m="2150000">u plus iv is the complex solution to a real</span> <span m="2153000">differential equation with constant coefficients.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2156000">A stiff spring, one that pulls with hard force</span> <span m="2158000">is going to make that thing go back and forth,</span> <span m="2161000">particularly at the dipping is weak.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2165000">So, let's use almost the same equation as I've just concealed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2169000">But, do you remember a used four here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2172000">Okay, before we used three and we got the solution to look like</span> <span m="2177000">that. Now, we will give it a little</span> <span m="2179000">more energy by putting some moxie in the springs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2183000">So now, the spring is pulling a little harder,</span> <span m="2186000">bigger force, a stiffer spring.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2190000">Okay, the characteristic equation is now going to be r</span> <span m="2195000">squared plus 4r plus five is equal to zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2200000">And therefore, if I solve for r,</span> <span m="2203000">I'm not going to bother trying to factor this because I</span> <span m="2209000">prepared for this lecture, and I know, quadratic formula</span> <span m="2214000">time, minus four plus or minus the square root of b squared,</span> <span m="2220000">16, minus four times five, 16 minus 20 is negative four</span> <span m="2225000">all over two. And therefore,</span> <span m="2229000">that makes negative two plus or minus, this makes,</span> <span m="2233000">simply, i. 2i divided by two,</span> <span m="2235000">which is i. So, the exponential solution is</span> <span m="2239000">e to the negative two, you don't have to write this</span> <span m="2243000">in. You can get the thing directly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2246000">t, let's use the one with the plus sign, and that's going to</span> <span m="2251000">give, as the real solutions, e to the negative two t times</span> <span m="2256000">cosine t, and e to the negative 2t times</span> <span m="2261000">the sine of t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2266000">And therefore, the solution is going to be y</span> <span m="2271000">equals e to the negative 2t times</span> <span m="2278000">(c1 cosine t plus c2 sine t).</span> </p>
<p><span m="2284000">If you want to put initial conditions, you can put them in</span> <span m="2288000">the same way I did them before. Suppose we use the same initial</span> <span m="2292000">conditions: y of zero equals one,</span> <span m="2295000">and y prime of zero equals one, equals zero,</span> <span m="2299000">let's say, wait, blah, blah, blah,</span> <span m="2302000">zero, yeah. Okay, I'd like to take time to</span> <span m="2304000">actually do the calculation, but there's nothing new in it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2310000">I'd have to take, calculate the derivative here,</span> <span m="2315000">and then I would substitute in, solve equations,</span> <span m="2320000">and when you do all that, just as before,</span> <span m="2324000">the answer that you get is y equals e to the negative 2t,</span> <span m="2330000">so, choose the constants c1 and c2</span> <span m="2335000">by solving linear equations, and the answer is cosine t,</span> <span m="2341000">so, c1 turns out to be one, and c2 turns out to be two,</span> <span m="2347000">I hope. Okay, I want to know,</span> <span m="2351000">but what does that look like? Well, use that trigonometric</span> <span m="2355000">identity. The e to the negative 2t</span> <span m="2358000">is just a real factor which is going to</span> <span m="2361000">reproduce itself. The question is,</span> <span m="2364000">what is cosine t plus 2 sine t look like?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2368000">What's its amplitude as a pure oscillation?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2371000">It's the square root of one plus two squared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2375000">Remember, it depends on looking</span> <span m="2379000">at that little triangle, which is one,</span> <span m="2381000">two, this is a different scale than that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2384000">And here is the square root of five, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2387000">And, here is phi, the phase lag.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2390000">So, it's equal to the square root of five.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2393000">So, it's the square root of five times e to</span> <span m="2397000">the negative 2t, and the stuff inside is the</span> <span m="2400000">cosine of, the frequency is one. Circular frequency is one,</span> <span m="2406000">so it's t minus phi, where phi is this angle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2410000">How big is that, one and two?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2413000">Well, if this were the square root of three,</span> <span m="2416000">which is a little less than two, it would be 60 infinity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2420000">So, this must be 70 infinity. So, phi is 70 infinity plus or minus</span> <span m="2424000">five, let's say. So, it looks like a slightly</span> <span m="2429000">delayed cosine curve, but the amplitude is falling.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2432000">So, it has to start. So, if I draw it,</span> <span m="2435000">here's one, here is, let's say, the square root of</span> <span m="2439000">five up about here. Then, the square root of five</span> <span m="2443000">times e to the negative 2t looks maybe</span> <span m="2447000">something like this. So, that's square root of five</span> <span m="2451000">e to the negative 2t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2454000">This is cosine t, but shoved over by not quite pi</span> <span m="2459000">over two. It starts at one,</span> <span m="2462000">and with the slope zero. So, the solution starts like</span> <span m="2466000">this. It has to be guided in its</span> <span m="2468000">amplitude by this function out there, and in between it's the</span> <span m="2473000">cosine curve. But it's moved over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2475000">So, if this is pi over two, the first time it crosses,</span> <span m="2480000">it's 72 infinity to the right of that. So, if this is pi</span> <span m="2484000">over two, it's pi over two plus 70 infinity where it crosses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2487000">So, it must be doing something like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2492000">And now, on the other side, it's got to stay within the</span> <span m="2496000">same amplitude. So, it must be doing something</span> <span m="2500000">like this. Okay, that gets us to,</span> <span m="2503000">if this is the under-damped case, because if you're trying</span> <span m="2508000">to do this with a swinging door, it means the door's going to be</span> <span m="2514000">swinging back and forth. Or, our little mass now hidden,</span> <span m="2519000">but you could see it behind that board, is going to be doing</span> <span m="2524000">this. But, it never stops.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2527000">It never stops. It doesn't realize,</span> <span m="2531000">but not in theoretical life. So, this is the under-damped.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2536000">All right, so it's like Goldilocks and the Three Bears.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2541000">That's too hot, and this is too cold.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2545000">What is the thing which is just right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2550000">Well, that's the thing you're going to study on the problem</span> <span m="2557000">set. So, just right is called</span> <span m="2560000">critically damped. It's what people aim for in</span> <span m="2566000">trying to damp motion that they don't want.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2571000">Now, what's critically damped? It must be the case just in</span> <span m="2578000">between these two. Neither complex,</span> <span m="2583000">nor the roots different. It's the case of two equal</span> <span m="2588000">roots. So, r squared plus Ar plus B</span> <span m="2591000">equals zero has two equal roots.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2597000">Now, that's a very special equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2600000">Suppose we call the root, since all of these,</span> <span m="2604000">notice these roots in this physical case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2610000">The roots always turn out to be negative numbers,</span> <span m="2613000">or have a negative real part. I'm going to call the root a.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2617000">So, r equals negative a, the root.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2620000">a is understood to be a positive number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2623000">I want that root to be really negative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2625000">Then, the equation looks like, the characteristic equation is</span> <span m="2630000">going to be r plus a, right, if the root is negative</span> <span m="2633000">a, squared because it's a double root.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2637000">And, that means the equation is of the form r squared plus two</span> <span m="2641000">times a r plus a squared equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2647000">In other words, the ODE looked like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2650000">The ODE looked like y double prime plus 2a y prime</span> <span m="2655000">plus, in other words,</span> <span m="2658000">the damping and the spring constant were related in this</span> <span m="2662000">special wake, that for a given value of the</span> <span m="2666000">spring constant, there was exactly one value of</span> <span m="2670000">the damping which produced this in between case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2676000">Now, what's the problem connected with it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2679000">Well, the problem, unfortunately,</span> <span m="2682000">is staring us in the face when we want to solve it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2686000">The problem is that we have a solution, but it is y equals e</span> <span m="2691000">to the minus at. I don't have another root to</span> <span m="2696000">get another solution with. And, the question is,</span> <span m="2701000">where do I get that other solution from?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2704000">Now, there are three ways to get it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2706000">Well, there are four ways to get it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2709000">You look it up in Euler. That's the fourth way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2712000">That's the real way to do it. But, I've given you one way as</span> <span m="2716000">problem number one on the problem set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2719000">I've given you another way as problem number two on the</span> <span m="2723000">problem set. And, the third way you will</span> <span m="2726000">have to wait for about a week and a half.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2728000">And, I will give you a third way, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2733000">By that time, you won't want to see any more</span> <span m="2736000">ways. But, I'd like to introduce you</span> <span m="2739000">to the way on the problem set. And, it is this,</span> <span m="2743000">that if you know one solution to an equation,</span> <span m="2747000">which looks like a linear equation, in fact,</span> <span m="2751000">the piece can be functions of t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2754000">They don't have to be constant, so I'll use the books notation</span> <span m="2759000">with p's and q's. y prime plus q y equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2765000">If you know one solution, there's an absolute,</span> <span m="2768000">ironclad guarantee, if you'll know that it's true</span> <span m="2773000">because I'm asking you to prove it for yourself.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2777000">There's another of the form, having this as a factor,</span> <span m="2781000">one solution y one, let's call it,</span> <span m="2784000">y equals y1 u is another solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2788000">And, you will be able to find u, I swear.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2793000">Now, let's, in the remaining couple of minutes carry that out</span> <span m="2797000">just for this case because I want you to see how to arrange</span> <span m="2801000">the work nicely. And, I want you to arrange your</span> <span m="2804000">work when you do the problem sets in the same way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2808000">So, the way to do it is, the solution we know is e to</span> <span m="2812000">the minus at. So, we are going to look for a</span> <span m="2816000">solution to this differential equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2820000">That's the differential equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2822000">And, the solution we are going to look for is of the form e to</span> <span m="2828000">the negative at times u.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2832000">Now, you're going to have to make calculation like this</span> <span m="2837000">several times in the course of the term.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2840000">Do it this way. y prime equals,</span> <span m="2843000">differentiate, minus a e to the minus a t u</span> <span m="2847000">plus e to the minus a t u prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2853000">And then, differentiate again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2857000">The answer will be a squared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2859000">You differentiate this: a squared e to the negative at</span> <span m="2863000">u. I'll have to do this a little</span> <span m="2867000">fast, but the next term will be, okay, minus,</span> <span m="2870000">so this times u prime, and from this are you going to</span> <span m="2873000">get another minus. So, combining what you get from</span> <span m="2877000">here, and here, you're going to get minus 2a e</span> <span m="2880000">to the minus a t u prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2885000">And then, there is a final term, which comes from this,</span> <span m="2888000">e to the minus a t u double prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2891000">Two of these, because of a piece here and a</span> <span m="2895000">piece here combine to make that. And now, to plug into the</span> <span m="2899000">equation, you multiply this by one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2901000">In other words, you don't do anything to it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2904000">You multiply this line by 2a, and you multiply that line by a</span> <span m="2908000">squared, and you add them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2912000">On the left-hand side, I get zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2914000">What do I get on the right? Notice how I've arrange the</span> <span m="2919000">work so it adds nicely. This has a squared times this,</span> <span m="2923000">plus 2a times that, plus one times that makes zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2927000">2a times this plus one times this makes zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2930000">All that survives is e to the a t u double prime,</span> <span m="2936000">and therefore, e to the minus a t u double</span> <span m="2939000">prime is equal to zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2944000">So, please tell me, what's u double prime?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2946000">It's zero. So, please tell me,</span> <span m="2949000">what's u? It's c1 t plus c2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2951000">Now, that gives me a whole</span> <span m="2954000">family of solutions. Just t would be enough because</span> <span m="2957000">all I am doing is looking for one solution that's different</span> <span m="2962000">from e to the minus a t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2964000">And, that solution, therefore, is y equals e to the</span> <span m="2968000">minus a t times t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2972000">And, there's my second solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2974000">So, this is a solution of the critically damped case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2977000">And, you are going to use it in three or four of the different</span> <span m="2982000">problems on the problem set. But, I think you can deal with</span> <span m="2986000">virtually the whole problem set, except for the last problem,</span> <span m="2990000">now.</span> </p>
