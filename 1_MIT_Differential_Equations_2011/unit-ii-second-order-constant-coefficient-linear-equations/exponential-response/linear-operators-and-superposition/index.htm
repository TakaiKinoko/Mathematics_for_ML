<p><span m="0">y prime and y double prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4000">So, q of x times y equal zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="9000">The linearity of the equation, that is, the form in which it</span> <span m="15000">appears is going to be the key idea today.</span> </p>
<p><span m="20000">Today is going to be theoretical, but some of the</span> <span m="25000">ideas in it are the most important in the course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="32000">So, I don't have to apologize for the theory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="37000">Remember, the solution method was to find two independent y</span> <span m="45000">one, y two independent solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="51000">And now, I'll formally write out what independent means.</span> </p>
<p><span m="60000">There are different ways to say it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="63000">But for you, I think the simplest and most</span> <span m="67000">intelligible will be to say that y2 is not to be a constant</span> <span m="72000">multiple of y1. And, unfortunately,</span> <span m="75000">it's necessary to add, nor is y1 to be a constant</span> <span m="80000">multiple. I have to call it by different</span> <span m="84000">constants. So, let's call this one c prime</span> <span m="88000">of y2. Well, I mean,</span> <span m="91000">the most obvious question is, well, look.</span> </p>
<p><span m="95000">If this is not a constant times that, this can't be there</span> <span m="101000">because I would just use one over c if it was.</span> </p>
<p><span m="106000">Unfortunately, the reason I have to write it</span> <span m="111000">this way is to take account of the possibility that y1 might be</span> <span m="117000">zero. If y1 is zero,</span> <span m="119000">so, the bad case that must be excluded is that y1 equals zero,</span> <span m="126000">y2 nonzero. I don't want to call those</span> <span m="130000">independent. But nonetheless,</span> <span m="133000">it is true that y2 is not a constant multiple of y1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="136000">However, y1 is a constant multiple of y2,</span> <span m="139000">namely, the multiple zero. It's just to exclude that case</span> <span m="143000">that I have to say both of those things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="146000">And, one would not be sufficed. That's a fine point that I'm</span> <span m="153000">not going to fuss over. But I just have,</span> <span m="157000">of course. Now, why do you do that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="161000">That's because, then, all solutions,</span> <span m="165000">and this is what concerns us today, are what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="170000">The linear combination with constant coefficients of these</span> <span m="176000">two, and the fundamental question we have to answer today</span> <span m="182000">is, why? Now, there are really two</span> <span m="187000">statements involved in that. On the one hand,</span> <span m="193000">I'm claiming there is an easier statement, which is that they</span> <span m="200000">are all solutions. So, that's question one,</span> <span m="204000">or statement one. Why are all of these guys</span> <span m="209000">solutions? That, I could trust you to</span> <span m="213000">answer yourself. I could not trust you to answer</span> <span m="217000">it elegantly. And, it's the elegance that's</span> <span m="219000">the most important thing today because you have to answer it</span> <span m="224000">elegantly. Otherwise, you can't go on and</span> <span m="226000">do more complicated things. If you answer it in an ad hoc</span> <span m="230000">basis just by hacking out a computation, you don't really</span> <span m="234000">see what's going on. And you can't do more difficult</span> <span m="238000">things later. So, we have to answer this,</span> <span m="242000">and answer it nicely. The second question is,</span> <span m="245000">so, if that answers why there are solutions at all,</span> <span m="249000">why are they all the solutions? Why all the solutions?</span> </p>
<p><span m="254000">In other words, to say it as badly as possible,</span> <span m="257000">why are all solutions, why all the solutions-- Never</span> <span m="261000">mind. Why are all the solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="264000">This is a harder question to answer, but that should make you</span> <span m="269000">happy because that means it depends upon a theorem which I'm</span> <span m="274000">not going to prove. I'll just quote to you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="280000">Let's attack there for problem one first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="287000">q1 is answered by what's called the superposition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="296000">The superposition principle says exactly that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="305000">It says exactly that, that if y1 and y2 are solutions</span> <span m="309000">to a linear equation, to a linear homogeneous ODE,</span> <span m="312000">in fact it can be of higher order, too, although I won't</span> <span m="317000">stress that. In other words,</span> <span m="319000">you don't have to stop with the second derivative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="323000">You could add a third derivative and a fourth</span> <span m="326000">derivative. As long as the former makes the</span> <span m="330000">same, but that implies automatically that c1 y1 plus c2</span> <span m="334000">y2 is a solution. Now, the way to do that nicely</span> <span m="339000">is to take a little detour and talk a little bit about linear</span> <span m="343000">operators. And, since we are going to be</span> <span m="346000">using these for the rest of the term, this is the natural place</span> <span m="351000">for you to learn a little bit about what they are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="354000">So, I'm going to do it. Ultimately, I am aimed at a</span> <span m="358000">proof of this statement, but there are going to be</span> <span m="362000">certain side excursions I have to make.</span> </p>
<p><span m="366000">The first side side excursion is to write the differential</span> <span m="370000">equation in a different way. So, I'm going to just write its</span> <span m="375000">transformations. The first, I'll simply recopy</span> <span m="379000">what you know it to be, q y equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="382000">That's the first form. The second form,</span> <span m="385000">I'm going to replace this by the differentiation operator.</span> </p>
<p><span m="391000">So, I'm going to write this as D squared y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="395000">That means differentiate it twice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="398000">D it, and then D it again. This one I only have to</span> <span m="402000">differentiate once, so I'll write that as p D(y),</span> <span m="406000">p times the derivative of Y. The last one isn't</span> <span m="410000">differentiated at all. I just recopy it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="413000">Now, I'm going to formally factor out the y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="417000">So this, I'm going to turn into D squared plus pD plus q.</span> </p>
<p><span m="422000">Now, everybody reads this as</span> <span m="427000">times y equals zero. But, what it means is this guy,</span> <span m="433000">it means this is shorthand for that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="436000">I'm not multiplying. I'm multiplying q times y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="441000">But, I'm not multiplying D times y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="445000">I'm applying D to y. Nonetheless,</span> <span m="448000">the notation suggests this is very suggestive of that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="452000">And this, in turn, implies that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="455000">I'm just transforming it. And now, I'll take the final</span> <span m="459000">step. I'm going to view this thing in</span> <span m="462000">parentheses as a guy all by itself, a linear operator.</span> </p>
<p><span m="466000">This is a linear operator, called a linear operator.</span> </p>
<p><span m="470000">And, I'm going to simply abbreviate it by the letter L.</span> </p>
<p><span m="474000">And so, the final version of this equation has been reduced</span> <span m="478000">to nothing but Ly equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="483000">Now, what's L? You can think of L as,</span> <span m="485000">well, formally, L you would write as D squared</span> <span m="489000">plus pD plus q. But, you can think of L,</span> <span m="493000">the way to think of it is as a black box, a function of what</span> <span m="498000">goes into the black box, well, if this were a function</span> <span m="502000">box, what would go it would be a number, and what would come out</span> <span m="507000">with the number. But it's not that kind of a</span> <span m="511000">black box. It's an operator box,</span> <span m="514000">and therefore, what goes in is a function of</span> <span m="518000">x. And, what comes out is another</span> <span m="521000">function of x, the result of applying this</span> <span m="524000">operator to that. So, from this point of view,</span> <span m="528000">differential equations, trying to solve the</span> <span m="532000">differential equation means, what should come out you want</span> <span m="537000">to come out zero, and the question is,</span> <span m="540000">what should you put in? That's what it means solving</span> <span m="545000">differential equations in an inverse problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="548000">The easy thing is to put it a function, and see what comes</span> <span m="551000">out. You just calculate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="553000">The hard thing is to ask, you say, I want such and such a</span> <span m="556000">thing to come out, for example,</span> <span m="558000">zero; what should I put in? That's a difficult question,</span> <span m="562000">and that's what we're spending the term answering.</span> </p>
<p><span m="565000">Now, the key thing about this is that this is a linear</span> <span m="568000">operator. And, what that means is that it</span> <span m="572000">behaves in a certain way with respect to functions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="577000">The easiest way to say it is, I like to make two laws of it,</span> <span m="582000">that L of u1, if you have two functions,</span> <span m="585000">I'm not going to put up the parentheses, x,</span> <span m="589000">because that just makes things look longer and not any clearer,</span> <span m="595000">actually. What does L do to the sum of</span> <span m="598000">two functions? If that's a linear operator,</span> <span m="603000">if you put in the sum of two functions, what you must get out</span> <span m="608000">is the corresponding L's, the sum of the corresponding</span> <span m="612000">L's of each. So, that's a law.</span> </p>
<p><span m="614000">And, the other law, linearity law,</span> <span m="617000">and this goes for anything in mathematics and its</span> <span m="621000">applications, which is called linear,</span> <span m="624000">basically anything is linear if it does the following thing to</span> <span m="629000">functions or numbers or whatever.</span> </p>
<p><span m="633000">The other one is of a constant times any function,</span> <span m="637000">I don't have to give it a number now because I'm only</span> <span m="641000">using one of them, should be equal to c times L of</span> <span m="646000">u. So, here, c is a constant,</span> <span m="648000">and here, of course, the u is a function,</span> <span m="651000">functions of x. These are the two laws of</span> <span m="655000">linearity. An operator is linear if it</span> <span m="658000">satisfies these two laws. Now, for example,</span> <span m="663000">the differentiation operator is such an operator.</span> </p>
<p><span m="666000">D is linear, why?</span> </p>
<p><span m="667000">Well, because of the very first things you verify after you</span> <span m="671000">learn what the derivative is because the derivative of,</span> <span m="675000">well, I will write it in the D form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="677000">I'll write it in the form in which you know it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="680000">It would be D apply to u1 plus u2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="683000">How does one write that in ordinary calculus?</span> </p>
<p><span m="686000">Well, like that. Or, maybe you write d by dx out</span> <span m="691000">front. Let's write it this way,</span> <span m="693000">is equal to u1 prime plus u2 prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="696000">That's a law. You prove it when you first</span> <span m="699000">study what a derivative is. It's a property.</span> </p>
<p><span m="702000">From our point of view, it's a property of the</span> <span m="705000">differentiation operator. It has this property.</span> </p>
<p><span m="708000">The D of u1 plus u2 is D of u1 plus D of u2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="712000">And, it also has the property</span> <span m="715000">that c u prime, you can pull out the constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="720000">That's not affected by the differentiation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="723000">So, these two familiar laws from the beginning of calculus</span> <span m="727000">say, in our language, that D is a linear operator.</span> </p>
<p><span m="731000">What about the multiplication of law?</span> </p>
<p><span m="734000">That's even more important, that u1 times u2 prime,</span> <span m="738000">I have nothing whatever to say about that in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="742000">In this context, it's an important law,</span> <span m="745000">but it's not important with respect to the study of</span> <span m="749000">linearity. So, there's an example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="753000">Here's a more complicated one that I'm claiming is the linear</span> <span m="758000">operator. And, since I don't want to have</span> <span m="761000">to work in this lecture, the work is left to you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="765000">So, the proof, prove that L is linear,</span> <span m="768000">is this particular operator. L is linear.</span> </p>
<p><span m="771000">That's in your part one homework to verify that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="775000">And you will do some simple exercises in recitation tomorrow</span> <span m="779000">to sort of warm you up for that if you haven't done it already.</span> </p>
<p><span m="786000">Well, you shouldn't have because this only goes with this</span> <span m="793000">lecture, actually. It's forbidden to work ahead in</span> <span m="799000">this class. All right, where are we?</span> </p>
<p><span m="803000">Well, all that was a prelude to proving this simple theorem,</span> <span m="811000">superposition principle. So, finally,</span> <span m="815000">what's the proof? The proof of the superposition</span> <span m="822000">principle: if you believe that the operator is linear,</span> <span m="830000">then L of c1, in other words,</span> <span m="833000">the ODE is L. L is D squared plus pD plus q.</span> </p>
<p><span m="839000">So, the ODE is Ly equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="844000">And, what am I being asked to</span> <span m="847000">prove? I'm being asked to prove that</span> <span m="850000">if y1 and y2 are solutions, then so is that thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="853000">By the way, that's called a linear combination.</span> </p>
<p><span m="856000">Put that in your notes. Maybe I better write it even on</span> <span m="860000">the board because it's something people say all the time without</span> <span m="864000">realizing they haven't defined it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="866000">This is called a linear combination.</span> </p>
<p><span m="870000">This expression is called a linear combination of y1 and y2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="875000">It means that particular sum with constant coefficients.</span> </p>
<p><span m="880000">Okay, so, the ODE is Ly equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="884000">And, I'm trying to prove that fact about it,</span> <span m="888000">that if y1 and y2 are solutions, so is a linear</span> <span m="892000">combination of them. So, the proof,</span> <span m="895000">then, I start with apply L to c1 y1 plus c2 y2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="900000">Now, because this operator is</span> <span m="905000">linear, it takes the sum of two functions into the corresponding</span> <span m="910000">sum up what the operator would be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="913000">So, it would be L of c1 y1 plus L of c2 y2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="917000">That's because L is a linear</span> <span m="920000">operator. But, I don't have to stop</span> <span m="923000">there. Because L is a linear operator,</span> <span m="926000">I can pull the c out front. So, it's c1 L of y1 plus c2 L</span> <span m="931000">of y2. Now, where am I?</span> </p>
<p><span m="936000">Trying to prove that this is zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="938000">Well, what is L of y1? At this point,</span> <span m="940000">I use the fact that y1 is a solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="943000">Because it's a solution, this is zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="946000">That's what it means to solve that differential equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="950000">It means, when you apply the linear operator,</span> <span m="953000">L, to the function, you get zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="955000">In the same way, y2 is a solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="957000">So, that's zero. And, the sum of c1 times zero</span> <span m="962000">plus c2 times zero is zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="965000">That's the argument. Now, you could make the same</span> <span m="968000">argument just by plugging c1 y1, plugging it into the equation</span> <span m="973000">and calculating, and calculating,</span> <span m="975000">and calculating, grouping the terms and so on</span> <span m="978000">and so forth. But, that's just calculation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="981000">It doesn't show you why it's so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="984000">Why it's so is because the operator, this differential</span> <span m="988000">equation is expressed as a linear operator applied to y is</span> <span m="992000">zero. And, the only properties that</span> <span m="997000">are really been used as the fact that this operator is linear.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1006000">That's the key point. L is linear.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1010000">It's a linear operator. Well, that's all there is to</span> <span m="1017000">the superposition principle. As a prelude to answering the</span> <span m="1024000">more difficult question, why are these all the</span> <span m="1027000">solutions? Why are there no other</span> <span m="1029000">solutions? We need a few definitions,</span> <span m="1032000">and a few more ideas. And, they are going to occur in</span> <span m="1036000">connection with, so I'm now addressing,</span> <span m="1038000">ultimately, question two. But, it's not going to be</span> <span m="1042000">addressed directly for quite awhile.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1045000">Instead, I'm going to phrase it in terms of solving the initial</span> <span m="1049000">value problem. So far, we've only talked about</span> <span m="1054000">the general solution with those two arbitrary constants.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1059000">But, how do you solve the initial value problem,</span> <span m="1063000">in other words, fit initial conditions,</span> <span m="1066000">find the solution with given initial values for the function</span> <span m="1071000">and its derivatives. Now, --</span> <span m="1084000">-- the theorem is that this collection of functions with</span> <span m="1088000">these arbitrary constants, these are all the solutions we</span> <span m="1092000">have so far. In fact, they are all the</span> <span m="1095000">solutions there are, but we don't know that yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1099000">However, if we just focus on the big class of solutions,</span> <span m="1103000">there might be others lurking out there somewhere lurking out</span> <span m="1108000">there. I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1111000">But let's use what we have, that just from this family is</span> <span m="1119000">enough to satisfy any initial condition, to satisfy any</span> <span m="1127000">initial values. In other words,</span> <span m="1131000">if you give me any initial values, I will be able to find</span> <span m="1139000">the c1 and c2 which work. Now, why is that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1145000">Well, I'd have to do a song and dance at this point,</span> <span m="1148000">if you hadn't been softened up by actually calculating for</span> <span m="1152000">specific differential equations. You've had exercises and</span> <span m="1155000">actually how to calculate the values of c1 and c2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1159000">So, I'm going to do it now in general what you have done so</span> <span m="1163000">far for particular equations using particular values of the</span> <span m="1166000">initial conditions. So, I'm relying on that</span> <span m="1170000">experience that you've had in doing the homework to make</span> <span m="1175000">intelligible what I'm going to do now in the abstract using</span> <span m="1180000">just letters. So, why is this so?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1183000">Why is that so? Well, we are going to need it,</span> <span m="1187000">by the way, here, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1189000">I'll have to, again, open up parentheses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1192000">But let's go as far as we can. Well, you just try to do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1197000">Suppose the initial conditions are, how will we write them?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1204000">So, they're going to be at some initial point,</span> <span m="1206000">x0. You can take it to be zero if</span> <span m="1208000">you want, but I'd like to be, just for a little while,</span> <span m="1212000">a little more general. So, let's say the initial</span> <span m="1215000">conditions, the initial values are being given at the point x0,</span> <span m="1219000">all right, that's going to be some number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1221000">Let's just call it a. And, the initial value also has</span> <span m="1225000">to specify the velocity or the value of the derivative there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1230000">Let's say these are the initial values.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1233000">So, the problem is to find the c which work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1237000">Now, how do you do that? Well, you know from</span> <span m="1241000">calculation. You write y equals c1 y1 plus</span> <span m="1245000">c2 y2. And you write y prime,</span> <span m="1247000">and you take the derivative underneath that,</span> <span m="1251000">which is easy to do. And now, you plug in x equals</span> <span m="1256000">zero. And, what happens?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1260000">Well, these now turn into a set of equations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1264000">What will they look like? Well, y of x0 is a,</span> <span m="1268000">and this is b. So, what I get is let me flop</span> <span m="1272000">it over onto the other side because that's the way you're</span> <span m="1277000">used to looking at systems of equations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1281000">So, what we get is c1 times y1 of x0 plus c2 times y2 of x0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1286000">What's that supposed to be</span> <span m="1291000">equal to? Well, that's supposed to be</span> <span m="1294000">equal to y of x0. It's supposed to be equal to</span> <span m="1297000">the given number, a.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1299000">And, in the same way, c1 y1 prime of x0 plus c2 y2</span> <span m="1302000">prime of x0, that's supposed to turn out to</span> <span m="1306000">be the number, b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1308000">In the calculations you've done up to this point,</span> <span m="1311000">y1 and y2 were always specific functions like e to the x</span> <span m="1315000">or cosine of 22x,</span> <span m="1317000">stuff like that. Now I'm doing it in the</span> <span m="1321000">abstract, just calling them y1 and y2, so as to include all</span> <span m="1326000">those possible cases. Now, what am I supposed to do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1330000">I'm supposed to find c1 and c2. What kind of things are they?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1335000">This is what you studied in high school, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1339000">The letters are around us, but it's a pair of simultaneous</span> <span m="1343000">linear equations. What are the variables?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1346000">What are the variables? What are the variables?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1350000">Somebody raise their hand. If you have a pair of</span> <span m="1355000">simultaneous linear equations, you've got variables and you've</span> <span m="1359000">got constants, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1361000">And you are trying to find the answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1363000">What are the variables? Yeah?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1365000">c1 and c2. Very good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1367000">I mean, it's extremely confusing because in the first</span> <span m="1370000">place, how can they be the variables if they occur on the</span> <span m="1374000">wrong side? They're on the wrong side;</span> <span m="1377000">they are constants. How can constants be variables?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1382000">Everything about this is wrong. Nonetheless,</span> <span m="1386000">the c1 and the c2 are the unknowns, if you like the high</span> <span m="1390000">school terminology. c1 and c2 are the unknowns.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1394000">These messes are just numbers. After you've plugged in x0,</span> <span m="1399000">this is some number. You've got four numbers here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1403000">So, c1 and c2 are the variables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1406000">The two find, in other words,</span> <span m="1408000">to find the values of. All right, now you know general</span> <span m="1414000">theorems from 18.02 about when can you solve such a system of</span> <span m="1419000">equations. I'm claiming that you can</span> <span m="1422000">always find c1 and c2 that work. But, you know that's not always</span> <span m="1428000">the case that a pair of simultaneous linear equations</span> <span m="1432000">can be solved. There's a condition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1435000">There's a condition which guarantees their solution,</span> <span m="1439000">which is what? What has to be true about the</span> <span m="1444000">coefficients? These are the coefficients.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1448000">What has to be true? The matrix of coefficients must</span> <span m="1453000">be invertible. The determinant of coefficients</span> <span m="1458000">must be nonzero. So, they are solvable if,</span> <span m="1462000">for the c1 and c2, if this thing,</span> <span m="1465000">I'm going to write it. Since all of these are</span> <span m="1469000">evaluated at x0, I'm going to write it in this</span> <span m="1474000">way. y1, the determinant,</span> <span m="1478000">whose entries are y1, y2, y1 prime,</span> <span m="1481000">and y2 prime,</span> <span m="1484000">evaluated at zero, x0, that means that I evaluate</span> <span m="1489000">each of the functions in the determinant at x0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1494000">I'll write it this way. That should be not zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1500000">So, in other words, the key thing which makes this</span> <span m="1503000">possible, makes it possible for us to solve the initial value</span> <span m="1508000">problem, is that this funny determinant should not be zero</span> <span m="1513000">at the point at which we are interested.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1516000">Now, this determinant is important in 18.03.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1519000">It has a name, and this is when you're going</span> <span m="1523000">to learn it, if you don't know it already.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1526000">That determinant is called the Wronskian.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1531000">The Wronskian of what? If you want to be pompous,</span> <span m="1534000">you say this with a V sound instead of a W.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1537000">But, nobody does except people trying to be pompous.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1541000">The Wronskian, we'll write a W.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1543000">Now, notice, you can only calculate it when</span> <span m="1547000">you know what the two functions are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1549000">So, the Wronskian of the two functions, y1 and y2,</span> <span m="1553000">what's the variable? It's not a function of two</span> <span m="1556000">variables, y1 and y2. These are just the names of</span> <span m="1560000">functions of x. So, when you do it,</span> <span m="1564000">put it in, calculate out that determinant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1568000">This is a function of x, a function of the independent</span> <span m="1573000">variable after you've done the calculation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1577000">Anyway, let's write its definition, y1,</span> <span m="1580000">y2, y1 prime, y2 prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1583000">Now, in order to do this,</span> <span m="1586000">the point is we must know that that Wronskian is not zero,</span> <span m="1592000">that the Wronskian of these two functions is not zero at the</span> <span m="1597000">point x0. Now, enter a theorem which</span> <span m="1602000">you're going to prove for homework, but this is harder.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1607000">So, it's part two homework. It's not part one homework.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1611000">In other words, I didn't give you the answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1615000">You've got to find it yourself, alone or in the company of good</span> <span m="1621000">friends. So, anyway, here's the</span> <span m="1625000">Wronskian. Now, what can we say for sure?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1628000">Note, suppose y1 and y, just to get you a feeling for</span> <span m="1633000">it a little bit, suppose they were not</span> <span m="1636000">independent. The word for not independent is</span> <span m="1640000">dependent. Suppose they were dependent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1644000">In other words, suppose that y2 were a constant</span> <span m="1648000">multiple of y1. We know that's not the case</span> <span m="1653000">because our functions are supposed to be independent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1657000">But suppose they weren't. What would the value of the</span> <span m="1662000">Wronskian be? If y2 is a constant times y1,</span> <span m="1666000">then y2 prime is that same constant times y1 prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1670000">What's the value of the determinant?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1673000">Zero. For what values of x is it zero</span> <span m="1676000">for all values of x? And now, that's the theorem</span> <span m="1681000">that you're going to prove, that if y1 and y2 are solutions</span> <span m="1686000">to the ODE, I won't keep, say, it's the ODE we've been</span> <span m="1690000">talking about, y double prime plus py.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1694000">But the linear homogeneous with</span> <span m="1700000">not constant coefficients, just linear homogeneous second</span> <span m="1706000">order. Our solutions,</span> <span m="1709000">as there are only two possibilities,</span> <span m="1713000">either-or. Either the Wronskian of y,</span> <span m="1717000">there are only two possibilities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1719000">Either the Wronskian of y1 and y2 is always zero,</span> <span m="1724000">identically zero, zero for all values of x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1727000">This is redundant. When I say identically,</span> <span m="1731000">I mean for all values of x. But, I am just making assurance</span> <span m="1736000">doubly sure. Or, or the Wronskian is never</span> <span m="1741000">zero. Now, there is no notation as</span> <span m="1746000">for that. I'd better just write it out,</span> <span m="1750000">is never zero, i.e.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1753000">for no x is it, i.e.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1755000">for all x. There's no way to say that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1760000">I mean, for all values of x, it's not zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1766000">That means, there is not a single point for which it's</span> <span m="1772000">zero. In particular,</span> <span m="1775000">it's not zero here. So, this is your homework:</span> <span m="1783000">problem five, part two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1785000">I'll give you a method of proving it, which was discovered</span> <span m="1792000">by the famous Norwegian mathematician,</span> <span m="1797000">Abel, who is, I guess, the centenary of his</span> <span m="1802000">birth, I guess, was just celebrated last year.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1809000">He has one of the truly tragic stories in mathematics,</span> <span m="1813000">which I think you can read. It must be a Simmons book,</span> <span m="1818000">if you have that. Simmons is very good on</span> <span m="1822000">biographies. Look up Abel.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1824000">He'll have a biography of Abel, and you can weep if you're</span> <span m="1829000">feeling sad. He died at the age of 26 of</span> <span m="1834000">tuberculosis, having done a number of</span> <span m="1837000">sensational things, none of which was recognized in</span> <span m="1841000">his lifetime because people buried his papers under big</span> <span m="1846000">piles of papers. So, he died unknown,</span> <span m="1849000">uncelebrated, and now he's Norway's greatest</span> <span m="1853000">culture hero. In the middle of a park in</span> <span m="1856000">Oslo, there's a huge statue. And, since nobody knows what</span> <span m="1863000">Abel looked like, the statue is way up high so</span> <span m="1867000">you can't see very well. But, the inscription on the</span> <span m="1873000">bottom says Niels Henrik Abel, 1801-1826 or something like</span> <span m="1879000">that. Now, --</span> <span m="1898000">-- the choice, I'm still, believe it or not,</span> <span m="1901000">aiming at question two, but I have another big</span> <span m="1904000">parentheses to open. And, when I closed it,</span> <span m="1907000">the answer to question two will be simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1910000">But, I think it's very desirable that you get this</span> <span m="1913000">second big parentheses. It will help you to understand</span> <span m="1917000">something important. It will help you on your</span> <span m="1922000">problem set tomorrow night. I don't have to apologize.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1928000">I'm just going to do it. So, the question is,</span> <span m="1932000">the thing you have to understand is that when I write</span> <span m="1938000">this combination, I'm claiming that these are all</span> <span m="1943000">the solutions. I haven't proved that yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1947000">But, they are going to be all the solutions</span> <span m="1953000">The point is, there's nothing sacrosanct</span> <span m="1956000">about the y1 and y2. This is exactly the same</span> <span m="1961000">collection as a collection which I would write using other</span> <span m="1966000">constants. Let's call them u1 and u2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1969000">They are exactly the same, where u1 and u2 are any other</span> <span m="1975000">pair of linearly independent solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1980000">Any other pair of independent solutions, they must be</span> <span m="1985000">independent, either a constant multiple of each other.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1990000">In other words, u1 is some combination,</span> <span m="1993000">now I'm really stuck because I don't know how to,</span> <span m="1998000">c1 bar, let's say, that means a special value of</span> <span m="2002000">c1, and a special value of c2, and u2 is some other special</span> <span m="2008000">value, oh my God, c1 double bar,</span> <span m="2011000">how's that? The notation is getting worse</span> <span m="2016000">and worse. I apologize for it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2018000">In other words, I could pick y1 and y2 and make</span> <span m="2022000">up all of these. And, I'd get a bunch of</span> <span m="2025000">solutions. But, I could also pick some</span> <span m="2028000">other family, some other two guys in this</span> <span m="2031000">family, and just as well express the solutions in terms of u1 and</span> <span m="2036000">u2. Now, well, why is he telling us</span> <span m="2039000">that? Well, the point is that the y1</span> <span m="2043000">and the y2 are typically the ones you get easily from solving</span> <span m="2048000">the equations, like e to the x and e</span> <span m="2051000">to the 2x. That's what you've gotten,</span> <span m="2055000">or cosine x and sine x,</span> <span m="2058000">something like that. But, for certain ways,</span> <span m="2062000">they might not be the best way of writing the solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2066000">There is another way of writing those that you should learn,</span> <span m="2071000">and that's called finding normalized, the normalized.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2075000">They are okay, but they are not normalized.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2080000">For some things, the normalized solutions are</span> <span m="2082000">the best. I'll explain to you what they</span> <span m="2084000">are, and I'll explain to you what they're good for.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2088000">You'll see immediately what they're good for.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2090000">Normalized solutions, now, you have to specify the</span> <span m="2093000">point at which you're normalizing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2095000">In general, it would be x nought,</span> <span m="2098000">but let's, at this point, since I don't have an infinity</span> <span m="2101000">of time, to simplify things, let's say zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2105000">It could be x nought, any point would do just as</span> <span m="2108000">well. But, zero is the most common</span> <span m="2111000">choice. What are the normalized</span> <span m="2113000">solutions? Well, first of all,</span> <span m="2115000">I have to give them names. I want to still call them y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2119000">So, I'll call them capital Y1 and Y2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2121000">And, what they are, are the solutions which satisfy</span> <span m="2125000">certain, special, very special,</span> <span m="2127000">initial conditions. And, what are those?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2131000">So, they're the ones which satisfy, the initial conditions</span> <span m="2137000">for Y1 are, of course there are going to be guys that look like</span> <span m="2143000">this. The only thing that's going to</span> <span m="2146000">make them distinctive is the initial conditions they satisfy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2151000">Y1 has to satisfy at zero. Its value should be one,</span> <span m="2156000">and the value of its derivative should be zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2162000">For Y2, it's just the opposite. Here, the value of the function</span> <span m="2167000">should be zero at zero. But, the value of its</span> <span m="2171000">derivative, now, I want to be one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2174000">Let me give you a trivial example of this,</span> <span m="2177000">and then one, which is a little less trivial,</span> <span m="2181000">so you'll have some feeling for what I'm asking for.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2185000">Suppose the equation, for example,</span> <span m="2188000">is y double prime plus, well, let's really make it</span> <span m="2193000">simple. Okay, you know the standard</span> <span m="2196000">solutions are y1 is cosine x,</span> <span m="2199000">and y2 is sine x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2201000">These are functions, which, when you take the second</span> <span m="2204000">derivative, they turn into their negative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2206000">You know, you could go the complex roots are i and minus i,</span> <span m="2210000">and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,</span> <span m="2212000">blah. If you do it that way,</span> <span m="2213000">fine. But at some point in the course</span> <span m="2216000">you have to be able to write down and, right away,</span> <span m="2219000">oh, yeah, cosine x, sine x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2221000">Okay, what are the normalized</span> <span m="2225000">things? Well, what's the value of this</span> <span m="2229000">at zero? It is one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2231000">What's the value of its derivative at zero?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2235000">Zero. This is Y1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2236000">This is the only case in which you locked on immediately to the</span> <span m="2242000">normalized solutions. In the same way,</span> <span m="2246000">this guy is Y2 because its value at zero is zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2252000">It's value of its derivative at zero is one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2255000">So, this is Y2. Okay, now let's look at a case</span> <span m="2259000">where you don't immediately lock on to the normalized solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2264000">Very simple: all I have to do is change the</span> <span m="2267000">sign. Here, you know,</span> <span m="2269000">think through r squared minus one equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2274000">The characteristic roots are plus one and minus one,</span> <span m="2278000">right? And therefore,</span> <span m="2280000">the solution is e to the x, and e to the negative x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2284000">So, the solutions you find by</span> <span m="2287000">the usual way of solving it is y1 equals e to the x,</span> <span m="2291000">and y2 equals e to the negative x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2295000">Those are the standard solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2297000">So, the general solution is of the form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2299000">So, the general solution is of the form c1 e to the x plus c2 e</span> <span m="2303000">to the negative x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2306000">Now, what I want to find out is what is Y1 and Y2?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2311000">How do I find out what Y1 is? Well, I have to satisfy initial</span> <span m="2316000">conditions. So, if this is y,</span> <span m="2318000">let's write down here, if you can still see that,</span> <span m="2323000">y prime is c1 e to the x minus c2 e to the negative x .</span> </p>
<p><span m="2328000">So, if I plug in,</span> <span m="2331000">I want y of zero to be one, I want this guy at the point</span> <span m="2336000">zero to be one. What equation does that give</span> <span m="2340000">me? That gives me c1 plus c2,</span> <span m="2344000">c1 plus c2, plugging in x equals zero,</span> <span m="2348000">equals the value of this thing at zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2351000">So, that's supposed to be one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2354000">How about the other guy? The value of its derivative is</span> <span m="2359000">supposed to come out to be zero. And, what is its derivative?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2364000">Well, plug into this expression.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2366000">It's c1 minus c2. Okay, what's the solution to</span> <span m="2372000">those pair of equations? c2 has to be equal to c1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2376000">The sum of the two of them has to be one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2379000">Each one, therefore, is equal to one half.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2382000">And so, what's the value of Y1? Y1, therefore,</span> <span m="2386000">is the function where c1 and c2 are one half.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2390000">It's the function e to the x plus e to the negative x divided</span> <span m="2395000">by two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2399000">In the same way, I won't repeat the calculation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2403000">You can do yourself. Same calculation shows that Y2,</span> <span m="2407000">so, put in the initial conditions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2410000">The answer will be that Y2 is equal to e to the x minus e to</span> <span m="2415000">the minus x divided by two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2419000">These are the special functions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2422000">For this equation, these are the normalized</span> <span m="2425000">solutions. They are better than the</span> <span m="2428000">original solutions because their initial values are nicer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2435000">Just check it. The initial value,</span> <span m="2437000">when x is equal to zero, the initial value,</span> <span m="2440000">this has is zero. Here, when x is equal to zero,</span> <span m="2444000">the value of the function is zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2447000">But, the value of its derivative, these cancel,</span> <span m="2451000">is one. So, these are the good guys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2454000">Okay, there's no colored chalk this period.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2457000">Okay, there was colored chalk. There's one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2461000">So, for this equation, these are the good guys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2464000">These are our best solutions. e to the x and e to the</span> <span m="2467000">minus x are good solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2470000">But, these are our better solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2472000">And, this one, of course, is the function</span> <span m="2474000">which is called hyperbolic sine of x, and this is the one which</span> <span m="2478000">is called hyperbolic cosine of x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2480000">This is one of the most important ways in which they</span> <span m="2483000">enter into mathematics. And, this is why the engineers</span> <span m="2486000">want them. Now, why do the engineers want</span> <span m="2488000">normalized solutions? Well, I didn't explain that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2494000">So, what's so good about normalized solutions?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2501000">Very simple: if Y1 and Y2 are normalized at</span> <span m="2507000">zero, let's say, then the solution to the IVP,</span> <span m="2513000">in other words, the ODE plus the initial</span> <span m="2519000">values, y of zero equals, let's say, a and y</span> <span m="2527000">prime of zero equals b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2534000">So, the ODE I'm not repeating. It's the one we've been talking</span> <span m="2537000">about all term since the beginning of the period.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2540000">It's the one with the p of x and q of x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2543000">And, here are the initial values.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2545000">I'm going to call them a and b. You can also call them,</span> <span m="2548000">if you like, maybe that's better to call</span> <span m="2550000">them y0, as they are individual in the homework.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2554000">They are called, I'm using the,</span> <span m="2556000">let's use those. What is the solution?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2559000">I say the solution is, if you use y1 and y2,</span> <span m="2563000">the solution is y0, in other words,</span> <span m="2566000">the a times Y1, plus y0 prime,</span> <span m="2569000">in other words, b times Y2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2573000">In other words, you can write down instantly</span> <span m="2577000">the solution to the initial value problem,</span> <span m="2580000">if instead of using the functions, you started out with</span> <span m="2585000">the little Y1 and Y2, you use these better functions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2592000">The thing that's better about them is that they instantly</span> <span m="2596000">solve for you the initial value problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2598000">All you do is use this number, initial condition as the</span> <span m="2602000">coefficient of Y1, and use this number as the</span> <span m="2606000">coefficient of Y2. Now, just check that by looking</span> <span m="2609000">at it. Why is that so?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2612000">Well, for example, let's check.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2614000">What is its value of this function at zero?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2617000">Well, the value of this guy at zero is one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2620000">So, the answer is y0 times one, and the value of this guy at</span> <span m="2624000">zero is zero. So, this term disappears.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2627000">And, it's exactly the same with the derivative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2630000">What's the value of the derivative at zero?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2634000">The value of the derivative of this thing is zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2637000">So, this term disappears. The value of this derivative at</span> <span m="2641000">zero is one. And so, the answer is y0 prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2646000">So, check, check,</span> <span m="2648000">this works. So, these better solutions have</span> <span m="2651000">the property, what's good about them,</span> <span m="2654000">and why scientists and engineers like them,</span> <span m="2658000">is that they enable you immediately to write down the</span> <span m="2662000">answer to the initial value problem without having to go</span> <span m="2666000">through this business, which I buried down here,</span> <span m="2670000">of solving simultaneous linear equations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2675000">Okay, now, believe it or not, that's all the work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2680000">We are ready to answer question number two: why are these all</span> <span m="2686000">the solutions? Of course, I have to invoke a</span> <span m="2690000">big theorem. A big theorem:</span> <span m="2693000">where shall I invoke a big theorem?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2696000">Let's see if we can do it here. The big theorem says,</span> <span m="2702000">it's called the existence and uniqueness theorem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2705000">It's the last thing that's proved at the end of an analysis</span> <span m="2708000">course, at which real analysis courses, over which students</span> <span m="2711000">sweat for one whole semester, and their reward at the end is,</span> <span m="2715000">if they are very lucky, and if they have been very good</span> <span m="2718000">students, they get to see the proof of the existence and</span> <span m="2721000">uniqueness theorem for differential equations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2724000">But, I can at least say what it is for the linear equation</span> <span m="2727000">because it's so simple. It says, so,</span> <span m="2731000">the equation we are talking about is the usual one,</span> <span m="2735000">homogeneous equation, and I'm going to assume,</span> <span m="2739000">you have to have assumptions that p and q are continuous for</span> <span m="2744000">all x. So, they're good-looking</span> <span m="2746000">functions. Coefficients aren't allowed to</span> <span m="2750000">blow up anywhere. They've got to look nice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2755000">Then, the theorem says there is one and only one solution,</span> <span m="2763000">one and only solution satisfying, given initial values</span> <span m="2771000">such that y of zero, let's say y of zero is equal to</span> <span m="2779000">some given number, A,</span> <span m="2784000">and y, let's make y0, and y prime of zero equals B.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2791000">The initial value problem has</span> <span m="2797000">one and only one solution. The existence is,</span> <span m="2802000">it has a solution. The uniqueness is,</span> <span m="2805000">it only has one solution. If you specify the initial</span> <span m="2811000">conditions, there's only one function which satisfies them</span> <span m="2816000">and at the same time satisfies that differential equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2822000">Now, this answers our question. This answers our question,</span> <span m="2828000">because, look, what I want is all solutions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2834000">What we want are all solutions to the ODE.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2841000">And now, here's what I say: a claim that this collection of</span> <span m="2853000">functions, c1 Y1 plus c2 Y2 are all</span> <span m="2862000">solutions. Of course, I began a period by</span> <span m="2868000">saying I'd show you that c1 little y1 c little y2 are all</span> <span m="2872000">the solutions. But, it's the case that these</span> <span m="2875000">two families are the same. So, the family that I started</span> <span m="2880000">with would be exactly the same as the family c1 prime Y1</span> <span m="2884000">because, after all, these are two</span> <span m="2887000">special guys from that collection.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2891000">So, it doesn't matter whether I talk about the original ones,</span> <span m="2895000">or these. The theorem is still the same.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2899000">The final step, therefore, if you give me one</span> <span m="2902000">more minute, I think that will be quite enough.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2906000">Why are these all the solutions?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2910000">Well, I have to take an arbitrary solution and show you</span> <span m="2915000">that it's one of these. So, the proof is,</span> <span m="2919000">given a solution, u(x), what are its values?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2923000">Well, u of x zero is u zero,</span> <span m="2928000">and u prime of x zero, zero,</span> <span m="2931000">let's say, is equal to u zero, is equal to some other</span> <span m="2938000">number. Now, what's the solution?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2942000">Write down what's the solution of these using the Y1's?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2947000">Then, I know I've just shown you that u zero times Y1 plus u</span> <span m="2952000">zero prime Y2 satisfies the same initial</span> <span m="2957000">conditions, satisfies these initial conditions,</span> <span m="2961000">initial values. In other words,</span> <span m="2964000">I started with my little solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2967000">u of x walks up to and says, hi there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2971000">Hi there, and the differential equation looks at it and says,</span> <span m="2977000">who are you? You say, oh,</span> <span m="2981000">I satisfy you and my initial, and then it says what are your</span> <span m="2986000">initial values? It says, my initial values are</span> <span m="2990000">u0 and u0 prime. And, it said,</span> <span m="2994000">sorry, but we've got one of ours who satisfies the same</span> <span m="2999000">initial conditions. We don't need you because the</span> <span m="3003000">existence and uniqueness theorem says that there can only be one</span> <span m="3009000">function which does that. And therefore,</span> <span m="3013000">you must be equal to this guy by the uniqueness theorem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3020000">Okay, we'll talk more about stuff next time,</span> <span m="3023000">linear equation next time.</span> </p>
